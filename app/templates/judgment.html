                        Uber London Ltd (“Uber”) and Transopco (UK) Ltd (the latter trading as “Free Now”) are each operators licensed under the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”). Users of their services are able to book a private hire vehicle using a smartphone app. As is well known, an issue arose whether private hire vehicle drivers providing services to passengers through the Uber app were to be regarded as “workers” within the meaning of various provisions of employment protection legislation. The case,

That suggestion has given rise to the first issue in these proceedings.</p>

                        There are two claims before the court, which have been heard together. First, in Part 8 proceedings Uber, supported by Free Now, claims a declaration that an operator licensed under the 1998 Act who accepts a booking from a passenger is
                        <span style="font-style:italic">not</span>
                         required by the Act to enter as principal into a contractual obligation with the passenger to provide the journey in respect of that booking. In other words, Uber and Free Now say that Lord Leggatt’s suggestion in
                        <span style="font-style:italic">Uber v Aslam </span>
                        is wrong.

                        Second, in judicial review proceedings the United Trade Action Group Ltd (“UTAG”), the trade association for (among others) hackney carriage (or black cab) drivers, seeks to quash the decision made on 9
                        <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>
                         August 2020 by Transport for London (“TfL”) as the regulator to renew Free Now’s operator’s licence under the 1998 Act. It does so on two grounds, (1) that according to Free Now’s own terms and conditions, bookings are accepted by private hire vehicle drivers and not by Free Now itself, which is unlawful because, under the 1998 Act, the booking must be accepted by Free Now as the licensed operator; and (2) that private hire vehicles ply for hire in London using the Free Now app, which is unlawful as only licensed hackney carriage drivers can lawfully ply for hire. UTAG’s position is that the renewal of the licence by TfL was therefore unlawful because (in judicial review terms) (1) TfL failed to have regard to the unlawful way in which Free Now conducts its business by encouraging drivers to break the law, and (2) Free Now’s encouragement to its drivers to break the law means that TfL could not rationally conclude that Free Now is a fit and proper person to hold a licence. There is no equivalent judicial review challenge to Uber’s licence because, as Mr David Matthias QC for UTAG frankly acknowledged, any such challenge would be out of time. However there appears to be no material difference for the purpose of this case between the way in which Uber and Free Now conduct their business.

On this issue Uber and Free Now say that this is not necessary, while UTAG and the App Drivers and Couriers Union (“ADCU”) say that it is. TfL is neutral. Uber, Free Now and TfL say that this issue needs to be decided and this court should grant a declaration to decide the point one way or the other. UTAG says that Free Now’s terms and conditions mean that it is encouraging drivers to operate unlawfully and that the decision to grant it a licence should be quashed.</p>

                    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second issue is whether a driver soliciting passengers by means of the Free Now app (which is in all material respects identical to the Uber app) is “plying for hire” within the meaning of the Metropolitan Public Carriage Act 1869 (“the 1869 Act”) (“the Plying for Hire issue”). UTAG says that the answer is yes. Free Now and TfL deny this. If we accept UTAG’s position, there is a further issue as to remedy. UTAG says that we should quash the decision to grant Free Now an operator’s licence, either immediately or after a period of time, which would mean that Free Now had no licence and drivers using the app would have to cease to do so. Free Now, supported by TfL, says that it would be sufficient to grant a declaration, having regard in particular to the large number of licensed drivers whose livelihoods depend on obtaining business through apps such as Free Now’s.</p>

At that time, of course, the possibility of booking a vehicle using a smartphone app was not in contemplation. Booking was done either by telephone, or by going personally to a minicab office. Since the use of smartphone apps became possible, the private hire vehicle industry in London has grown significantly. The number of licensed private hire drivers in London has increased from about 65,000 such drivers in 2013 to 104,000 in 2021. </p>

They vary in their size and type, from single driver-operators, traditional telephone or walk-in minicab offices, through to operators with tens of thousands of drivers registered to their app-only booking platforms. As a result TfL’s approach to licensing and regulation must accommodate a wide range of situations, modes of providing services and levels of technical sophistication in each operating model.

The passenger’s use of the app is governed by “General Terms and Conditions for Users of the Free Now Platform” (“the User Terms”). When a passenger first installs the app on their smartphone, they are required to indicate their acceptance of these terms, although it is questionable how many passengers would read them. Separate agreements between Free Now and drivers are contained in “General Terms and Conditions for Drivers using the Free Now Platform” (“the Driver Terms”). No doubt Uber has a broadly similar contractual structure, although the terms of its agreements are not in evidence.</p>

                        TfL’s approach when considering an application for a private hire vehicle operator’s licence is to focus on the mechanics of the booking process, that is to say the various steps which make up that process: who accepts the booking, when it is accepted, how it might be cancelled, and so on. More often than not, TfL does not review the contractual terms of the operator when considering a licence application. This is deliberate. TfL’s view is that (in the words of Ms Helen Chapman, the Director of Licensing, Regulation and Charging) “a common sense approach should be taken to the question of whether there has been provision made for the invitation and acceptance of bookings, rather than seeking to answer that question by reference to the technicalities and complexities of the law of contract”. Ms Chapman refers to the case of

The app will determine their current location via GPS and will show, by means of an icon on the screen, which vehicles are in the vicinity of that customer. The customer enters their destination and a price is quoted. If the customer wishes to proceed, they press “Order Ride now”. The screen will show a message saying, “We are looking for a driver – FREE NOW has accepted your booking”. Drivers in the vicinity will be alerted to the booking by the app and can choose whether to carry it out. Once a driver agrees to carry out the booking, the passenger receives confirmation, including details of the vehicle and driver, and also an estimated arrival time. If there are no drivers available to carry out the booking, the passenger will receive a message “No driver found. Unfortunately, all drivers are busy at the moment. Hit retry if you still need a ride”. Payment is made by the customer to the company operating the app, here Uber or Free Now. That company will pay the driver the amount of the trip, less charges for using the app.</p>

                        <span style="font-style:italic">Uber v Aslam</span>
                        . The context was an argument by Uber that a driver should not be regarded as a “worker” because there was no contract whereby the driver undertook to perform work or services for Uber; rather, drivers were performing services solely for, and under, contracts made with passengers through the agency of Uber. Uber’s case was that the starting point for considering this argument should be to interpret the terms of the written agreements between Uber and drivers on the one hand, and between Uber and passengers on the other; and that the effect of these was that acceptance of a booking constituted a contract between the passenger and the driver to which Uber was not a party. It maintained that its only role was to act as a booking agent providing technology services and collecting payment as agent for the drivers.

                    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In Lord Leggatt’s view there were two fatal objections to this argument. The first was that it was not the correct approach to deciding whether drivers were working under workers’ contracts with Uber simply to apply ordinary principles of the law of contract and agency. The second was that there was in evidence no written agreement between Uber and drivers, nor was there any mechanism whereby a driver gave authority to Uber to act as his or her agent. However, Lord Leggatt went on to say that there was a third objection, which was that if the contractual scheme was as described by Uber, it would be unlawful because the 1998 Act requires acceptance by the operator of a contractual obligation owed to the passenger to carry out the booking and to provide a vehicle for that purpose. He said:</p>

It is an important feature of the context in which, as the employment tribunal found, Uber London recruits and communicates on a day to day basis with drivers that, as mentioned earlier: (1) it is unlawful for anyone in London to accept a private hire booking unless that person is the holder of a private hire vehicle operator’s licence for London; and (2) the only natural or legal person involved in the acceptance of bookings and provision of private hire vehicles booked through the Uber app which holds such a licence is Uber London. It is reasonable to assume, at least unless the contrary is demonstrated, that the parties intended to comply with the law in the way they dealt with each other.</p>

                        Uber maintains that the acceptance of private hire bookings by a licensed London PHV operator acting as agent for drivers would comply with the regulatory regime. I am not convinced by this. References in the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 to ‘acceptance’ of a private hire booking are reasonably understood to connote acceptance (personally and not merely for someone else) of a contractual obligation to carry out the booking and provide a vehicle for that purpose. This is implicit, for example, in section 4(2) of the Act quoted at para 31 above. It would in principle be possible for Uber London both to accept such an obligation itself and also to contract on behalf of the driver of the vehicle. However, if this were the arrangement made, it would seem hard to avoid the conclusion that the driver, as well as Uber London, would be a person who accepts the booking by undertaking a contractual obligation owed directly to the passenger to carry it out. If so, the driver would be in contravention of section 2(1) of the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 by accepting a private hire booking without holding a private hire vehicle operator’s licence for London. This suggests that the only contractual arrangement compatible with the licensing regime is one whereby Uber London as the licensed operator accepts private hire bookings as a principal (only) and, to fulfil its obligation to the passenger, enters into a contract with a transportation provider (be that an individual driver or a firm which in turn provides a driver) who agrees to carry out the booking for Uber London.

                        Counsel for Uber sought to resist this interpretation of the legislation on the basis that the legislation was enacted in the context of ‘a long-established industry practice’ under which PHV operators may merely act as agents for drivers who contract directly with passengers. Uber has adduced no evidence, however, of any such established practice which the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 may be taken to have been intended to preserve. I will consider later two cases involving minicab firms which were said by counsel for Uber to show that the courts have endorsed such an agency model. But it is sufficient to say now that in neither case was any consideration given to whether such an arrangement would comply with the licensing regime. The same is true of cases also relied on by Uber (along with a notice published by HMRC in 2002) which are concerned with how VAT applies to the supply of private hire vehicles. That material in my view has no bearing on the issues raised in these proceedings.

                        It is unnecessary, however, to express any concluded view on whether an agency model of operation would be compatible with the PHV licensing regime because there appears to be no factual basis for Uber’s contention that Uber London acts as an agent for drivers when accepting private hire bookings.”

                        Mr Ranjit Bhose QC for Uber submitted that the issue was a pure question of statutory interpretation, to which the precise terms of Uber’s contractual arrangements with drivers and passengers are irrelevant. If the court were to hold that, in order to comply with the 1998 Act, an operator is required to undertake a contractual obligation to passengers to provide the journey, Uber would be required to - and would - change its operating model in order to comply. But that is not how Uber currently operates. Mr Bhose submitted that it is not necessary for Uber to do so. The 1998 Act does not seek to regulate any private law relationships which may arise between those engaged in providing and using private hire vehicles, save in relation to sub-contracting. Its provisions are regulatory in nature and do not require any particular contractual relationships. Operators are therefore free to choose whatever contractual model they wish. They may choose to contract as principal with a passenger to provide transportation services, but may equally choose not to do so, as Uber has done. References in the 1998 Act to “acceptance” of a booking refer only to acceptance of the regulatory responsibilities set out in the Act and in the operator’s licence.

                         shows that concepts of contract law should not be introduced into the 1998 Act which is concerned with regulation in order to ensure public safety.

Acceptance of an obligation to carry out the journey by the operator is unnecessary in order to ensure public safety, which is ensured by the fact that regulatory obligations are also imposed on the driver and the vehicle, both of which have to be licensed, together with the obligation on the operator to keep records at its operating centre.</p>

Such terms state that Free Now acts as an intermediary between the passenger and the driver and does not provide transportation services (clause 2.2); that acceptance of an “Allocation” by a driver creates a direct contract between the passenger and the driver (clause 2.7); that Free Now is not liable for legal issues arising from the passenger’s contract with a driver, such as claims regarding breach of the contract or negligence on the part of the driver (clause 2.10); that Free Now is not jointly or severally liable for the services provided by the drivers because it is only an intermediary (clause 8.3); and that Free Now does not even guarantee that a driver is who they claim to be, or that a vehicle matches any description provided by it (clause 8.4).

                        We begin with three points of common ground. The first, summarised by Lord Leggatt in
                        <span style="font-style:italic">Uber v Aslam</span>
                         at [70] but also stated in a number of other Supreme Court cases, is that “the modern approach to statutory interpretation is to have regard to the purpose of a particular provision and to interpret its language, so far as possible, in the way which best gives effect to that purpose”. Second, the purpose of the 1998 Act was accurately summarised by Mr Justice Ouseley in
                        <span style="font-style:italic">Transport for London v Uber London Ltd</span>
                         [2015] EWHC 2918 (Admin) at [28]. It “was to bring the hitherto unlicensed mini-cab trade in London within a licensed framework, to protect the public using the services of mini-cabs from a variety of mischiefs including unfitness of the driver, the safety of the vehicle, and the absence of insurance”, as well as to preserve a visible and regulatory distinction between private hire vehicles and black cabs. Third, it does not matter that at the time of the 1998 Act the concept of ride-hailing apps using smartphones was not within Parliament’s contemplation. In order to give effect to a plain parliamentary purpose a statute may sometimes be held to cover a scientific development not known when the statute was passed (

That is what is meant by a “private hire booking”. The language of section 4, “private hire vehicles and drivers which are available to him for carrying out [a] booking accepted by him” indicates that it is the operator which carries out the booking (i.e. performs the contractual obligation to convey the passenger) and that it does so by means of the licensed vehicles and drivers available to it. The distinction proposed by Mr Kolvin between acceptance of a booking and the undertaking of an obligation to carry out the journey is illusory.</p>

Mr Bhose and Mr Kolvin had to accept that section 5 is concerned with sub-contracting by the operator and refers expressly to “the contract between the first operator and the person who made the booking” (subsection (4)) and to “a contract of hire between a person who made a private hire booking at an operating centre in London and the London PHV operator who accepted the booking”. Thus the contract between the operator and the passenger is a contract for the hire of a vehicle to undertake a journey. Mr Bhose and Mr Kolvin were driven to submit that section 5 applies when there is such a contract between an operator and a passenger, in which case sub-contracting is permitted; but that the Act permits an operator to accept a booking without creating such a contract; in the latter case, however, there is no scope for the operator to arrange for another operator to provide a vehicle to carry out the booking. They were unable, however, to suggest any reason why Parliament should have wished to legislate for only a sub-set of the ways in which an operator may offer its services to passengers. We can see none. </p>

                         that there will be. In our judgment, however, the Act does so require. To interpret the Act in this way gives effect to the statutory purpose of ensuring public safety. As Mr Galbraith-Marten pointed out, passengers booking journeys on these apps may be vulnerable; the journeys may be booked late at night; the consequences of a driver failing to turn up may be serious. If the passenger’s only contractual relationship is with a driver he or she has never heard of and who is in any event unlikely to be worth claiming against, any claim is likely to be practically worthless. Conversely, if the obligation must be undertaken by the operator, the operator will have a powerful incentive to ensure that the drivers it uses are reliable and, if something does go wrong, a remedy against the operator is likely to be worthwhile.

                         does not stand in the way of this analysis. It was a case under the 1976 Act. Mr Wilson held an operator’s licence to operate from premises in Hull, while his wife held an operator’s licence to operate from premises in Beverley. A passenger telephoned the Hull office to make a booking for a journey in Hull, which was accepted, but it turned out that the Hull office had passed on the request to the Beverley office, who had then telephoned Mr Wilson (who was also the driver) to carry out the booking. The issue was whether the booking had been accepted in Hull (which would have been lawful) or in Beverley (which would not). The argument appears to have been concerned with an analysis, by reference to principles of offer and acceptance, of where the contract was concluded. Giving the judgment of this court on a case stated by the magistrates, Mr Justice Buxton said that he “was careful to eschew, as this Court in its judgment in the case of
                        <span style="font-style:italic">Windsor and Maidenhead Royal Borough Council v Khan</span>
                         was careful to eschew, any attempt to introduce the complications or, indeed, even the simpler parts of the law of contract into this matter. It is simply a question of asking, in common sense terms, whether there has been provision made in the controlled district for invitation or acceptance of bookings”.

Rather, the court was concerned to avoid technical arguments about where a contract is concluded when a series of telephone conversations take place between persons in different areas: jurisdictional issues aside, such questions are only rarely of any practical significance.

Mr Justice Donovan agreed that the term connotes “some exhibition of the vehicle to potential hirers as a vehicle which may be hired”, although this does not necessarily require that the vehicle must be on view. Mr Justice Salmon also said that “a vehicle plies for hire if the person in control of the vehicle exhibits the vehicle and makes a present open offer to the public, an offer which can be accepted, for example, by the member of the public stepping into the vehicle”.</p>

                        “33. In my judgment, there was no unlawful plying for hire in this case for a number of reasons. First, the mere depiction of the defendant's vehicle on the Uber app, without either the vehicle or the driver being specifically identified or the customer using the app being able to select that vehicle, is insufficient to establish exhibition of the vehicle in the sense in which that phrase is used by Lord Parker CJ in formulating the two-stage test for plying for hire in the

                         [1962] 1 WLR 1010]. That requires not just exhibition of the vehicle but its exhibition expressly or implicitly soliciting custom, inviting members of the public to hire the vehicle.

                    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">34. It seems to me that depiction of the vehicle on the app does not involve any exhibition of that kind, but is for the assistance of the Uber customer using the app, who can see that there are vehicles in the vicinity of the type he or she wishes to hire. I agree with Mr Kolvin QC that the app is simply the use of modern technology to effect a similar transaction to those which have been carried out by PHV operators over the telephone for many years. If I ring a minicab firm and ask for a car to come to my house within five minutes and the operator says ‘I've got five cars round the corner from you. One of them will be with you in five minutes,’ there is nothing in that transaction which amounts to plying for hire. As a matter of principle, I do not consider that the position should be different because the use of internet technology avoids the need for the phone call.</p>

Whether this agency analysis is correct has not been finally decided. However, like the Chief Magistrate and contrary to Mr Holland's submissions, I do not consider that it has any bearing on the issue in this case. … </span>

                        <span style="color:#000000">37. Whatever the correct contractual analysis, in my judgment it has no impact on the question we have to decide. On any view, there is a pre-booking by the customer, which is recorded by Uber as PHV operator, before the specific vehicle which will perform the job is identified. This is all in accordance with the transaction being PHV business, not unlawful plying for hire. There was no soliciting by the defendant without some prior booking, as he only proceeded to the pick-up point after the customer had confirmed the booking and the defendant as driver had accepted the job. Whenever any contract was concluded, I have little doubt that this was not plying for hire, because on the facts found in this case, the customer could not use the defendant’s car without making a prior booking through the app. As with the charabanc in </span>

                        <span style="color:#000000">, the customer would make a booking to be picked up at a pre-arranged point. On the evidence in this case, all the Uber app did was to facilitate that booking.</span>

                        <span style="color:#000000">38. This leads on to the third reason why this was not plying for hire, which is the character of the waiting. The defendant was waiting in his vehicle until a customer confirmed a booking on the Uber app and he accepted that booking. There was no question of his soliciting custom during the period of waiting. His vehicle did not advertise itself as available for hire nor did he do anything which would have suggested to the public that he was available for hire. Indeed, as the Chief Magistrate found, if a member of the public had approached the vehicle and sought a ride, the defendant would have refused to take such a passenger off the street without a prior booking through the Uber app.</span>

                         was wrong. As a matter of ordinary language, a vehicle plies for hire if it drives around or parks in a public place waiting for someone who wants to hire it. That is what a driver using the Free Now app does from the moment when he logs on to the app as available to carry out bookings. The requirements set out in the cases should be applied to the development of new technology. A vehicle whose location is shown on the customer’s smartphone screen is for all practical purposes exhibited as available for hire. He submitted that the booking via the app for a vehicle which may be less than a minute away is in effect instantaneous rather than a prior booking – hence the trading name “Free Now” and the fact that the services are described as “ride hailing apps” in a way which treats them as equivalent to hailing a black cab. He cited an extract from a 2015 press article by a former Mayor of London:

You no longer need to hail a taxi by sticking your arm out or shouting; you just press a button and within minutes – seconds – the car will be at your side. The car can be parked up at a petrol station, or down a side street, or just dawdling in traffic, and – ping – it will be there. In other words the app is allowing private hire vehicles to behave like black taxis: to be hailed, to ply for hire in the streets, to do exactly what the law says they are not supposed to do. You have the instant (or virtually instant) accessibility of the black cab, with none of the extra costs entailed by the vehicle regulations or the Knowledge, and the growth of the business is huge.”</p>

                        . There was no material difference in the way that the drivers using the Uber app behaved, compared to those using Free Now, in the same way that there was no material difference in the operation of the two apps. A driver would wait, parked, or perhaps driving, until the app offered a hire to that driver, which would be accepted by use of the app. There was no plying for hire, and this point has already been decided by a court of like jurisdiction. Not only were there no proper grounds for distinguishing this most recent decision, it was in any event correctly decided.
