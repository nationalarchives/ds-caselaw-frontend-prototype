            Uber London Ltd (“Uber”) and Transopco (UK) Ltd (the latter trading as “Free Now”) are each
            operators licensed under the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”). Users of
            their services are able to book a private hire vehicle using a smartphone app. As is well known,
            an issue arose whether private hire vehicle drivers providing services to passengers through the
            Uber app were to be regarded as “workers” within the meaning of various provisions of employment
            protection legislation. The case, <em>Uber BV v Aslam</em> [2021] UKSC 5, [2021] ICR 657, went
            to the Supreme Court which held that they were.

            In the course of his judgment, with which the other members of the Court agreed, Lord Leggatt
            considered an argument advanced by Uber that it was acting as agent of the driver. He suggested,
            albeit without finally deciding the point, that in order to comply with the provisions of the 1998
            Act, Uber would have to accept a contractual obligation to the passenger as a principal to carry
            out the booking. That suggestion has given rise to the first issue in these proceedings.

            There are two claims before the court, which have been heard together. First, in Part 8
        proceedings Uber, supported by Free Now, claims a declaration that an operator licensed under
        the 1998 Act who accepts a booking from a passenger is
        <em>not</em>
        required by the Act to enter as principal into a contractual obligation with the passenger to
        provide the journey in respect of that booking. In other words, Uber and Free Now say that Lord
        Leggatt’s suggestion in
        <em>Uber v Aslam</em> is wrong.

            Second, in judicial review proceedings the United Trade Action Group Ltd (“UTAG”), the trade
            association for (among others) hackney carriage (or black cab) drivers, seeks to quash the
            decision made on 9<sup>th</sup>
            August 2020 by Transport for London (“TfL”) as the regulator to renew Free Now’s operator’s
            licence under the 1998 Act. It does so on two grounds, (1) that according to Free Now’s own
            terms and conditions, bookings are accepted by private hire vehicle drivers and not by Free Now
            itself, which is unlawful because, under the 1998 Act, the booking must be accepted by Free Now
            as the licensed operator; and (2) that private hire vehicles ply for hire in London using the
            Free Now app, which is unlawful as only licensed hackney carriage drivers can lawfully ply for
            hire. UTAG’s position is that the renewal of the licence by TfL was therefore unlawful because
            (in judicial review terms) (1) TfL failed to have regard to the unlawful way in which Free Now
            conducts its business by encouraging drivers to break the law, and (2) Free Now’s encouragement
            to its drivers to break the law means that TfL could not rationally conclude that Free Now is a
            fit and proper person to hold a licence. There is no equivalent judicial review challenge to
            Uber’s licence because, as Mr David Matthias QC for UTAG frankly acknowledged, any such
            challenge would be out of time. However there appears to be no material difference for the
            purpose of this case between the way in which Uber and Free Now conduct their business.

    <p class="judgment-body__section">
        <span class="judgment-body__number" id="paragraph_6"><a href="#paragraph_6">6.</a></span>
        <span class="judgment-body__text">The first issue is whether, in
        order to comply with the provisions of the 1998 Act, a licensed operator must accept a
        contractual obligation to the passenger as a principal to carry out the booking (“the Operator
        issue”). On this issue Uber and Free Now say that this is not necessary, while UTAG and the App
        Drivers and Couriers Union (“ADCU”) say that it is. TfL is neutral. Uber, Free Now and TfL say
        that this issue needs to be decided and this court should grant a declaration to decide the
        point one way or the other. UTAG says that Free Now’s terms and conditions mean that it is
        encouraging drivers to operate unlawfully and that the decision to grant it a licence should be
        quashed.</span>

        <span class="judgment-body__text">
            The second issue is whether a
        driver soliciting passengers by means of the Free Now app (which is in all material respects
        identical to the Uber app) is “plying for hire” within the meaning of the Metropolitan Public
        Carriage Act 1869 (“the 1869 Act”) (“the Plying for Hire issue”). UTAG says that the answer is
        yes. Free Now and TfL deny this. If we accept UTAG’s position, there is a further issue as to
        remedy. UTAG says that we should quash the decision to grant Free Now an operator’s licence,
        either immediately or after a period of time, which would mean that Free Now had no licence and
        drivers using the app would have to cease to do so. Free Now, supported by TfL, says that it
        would be sufficient to grant a declaration, having regard in particular to the large number of
        licensed drivers whose livelihoods depend on obtaining business through apps such as Free
        Now’s.

        <span class="judgment-body__text">
            Until the passing of the 1998 Act
            private hire vehicles in London (then generally known as “minicabs”) were unregulated. At that
            time, of course, the possibility of booking a vehicle using a smartphone app was not in
            contemplation. Booking was done either by telephone, or by going personally to a minicab office.
            Since the use of smartphone apps became possible, the private hire vehicle industry in London
            has grown significantly. The number of licensed private hire drivers in London has increased
            from about 65,000 such drivers in 2013 to 104,000 in 2021.

        <span class="judgment-body__text">
            According to the evidence of TfL, there were 1,919 licensed private hire vehicle operators in
            London as at 13<sup>th</sup>
            June 2021. They vary in their size and type, from single driver-operators, traditional telephone
            or walk-in minicab offices, through to operators with tens of thousands of drivers registered to
            their app-only booking platforms. As a result TfL’s approach to licensing and regulation must
            accommodate a wide range of situations, modes of providing services and levels of technical
            sophistication in each operating model.

            While there continue to be many
            minicab offices where a customer can make a booking either in person or by telephone, either for
            an immediate journey or for a future time, the introduction of smart phones and app-based
            services has significantly changed the way many private hire vehicle services are delivered,
            both in and outside London. In London there are a number of private hire vehicle operators,
            including Uber and Free Now, which only accept bookings by means of an app, generally known as a
            “ride hailing app”.

            There are two versions of the
            Free Now smartphone app. One is made available to passengers, the other to drivers. The
            passenger’s use of the app is governed by “General Terms and Conditions for Users of the Free
            Now Platform” (“the User Terms”). When a passenger first installs the app on their smartphone,
            they are required to indicate their acceptance of these terms, although it is questionable how
            many passengers would read them. Separate agreements between Free Now and drivers are contained
            in “General Terms and Conditions for Drivers using the Free Now Platform” (“the Driver Terms”).
            No doubt Uber has a broadly similar contractual structure, although the terms of its agreements
            are not in evidence.

        <span class="judgment-body__text">
            TfL’s approach when considering an application for a private hire vehicle operator’s licence is
            to focus on the mechanics of the booking process, that is to say the various steps which make up
            that process: who accepts the booking, when it is accepted, how it might be cancelled, and so
            on. More often than not, TfL does not review the contractual terms of the operator when
            considering a licence application. This is deliberate. TfL’s view is that (in the words of Ms
            Helen Chapman, the Director of Licensing, Regulation and Charging) <q>a common sense approach
            should be taken to the question of whether there has been provision made for the invitation and
            acceptance of bookings, rather than seeking to answer that question by reference to the
            technicalities and complexities of the law of contract</q>. Ms Chapman refers to the case of
            <span>Kingston upon Hull City Council v Wilson</span>
            [1995] 6 WLUK 360 as supporting this approach.

            A customer wishing to book a
            private hire vehicle using the Free Now app will log on to the app on their smartphone (it is
            also possible to use the app to order a hackney carriage but we are not concerned with that).
            The app will determine their current location via GPS and will show, by means of an icon on the
            screen, which vehicles are in the vicinity of that customer. The customer enters their
            destination and a price is quoted. If the customer wishes to proceed, they press <q>Order Ride
            now</q>. The screen will show a message saying, <q>We are looking for a driver – FREE NOW has
            accepted your booking</q>. Drivers in the vicinity will be alerted to the booking by the app and
            can choose whether to carry it out. Once a driver agrees to carry out the booking, the passenger
            receives confirmation, including details of the vehicle and driver, and also an estimated
            arrival time. If there are no drivers available to carry out the booking, the passenger will
            receive a message <q>No driver found. Unfortunately, all drivers are busy at the moment. Hit retry
            if you still need a ride</q>. Payment is made by the customer to the company operating the app,
            here Uber or Free Now. That company will pay the driver the amount of the trip, less charges for
            using the app.

            The 1998 Act established three
            kinds of licence which must exist in order for a private hire vehicle journey in London to be
            lawful. This was described in argument as a <q>triple lock</q>. There must be a licence for an
            operator (the requirements for which are dealt with in sections 2 to 5), the vehicle (sections 6
            to 11) and the driver (sections 12 to 14).

                <p>"(1) In this Act—</p>

                    acceptance of, or to accept, private hire bookings in relation to the vehicle. …

                    vehicle

                    available, as the case may be.

                <p>(4) In this Act ‘private hire booking’ means a booking for the hire of a private hire vehicle for the
                    purpose of carrying one or more passengers (including a booking to carry out as sub-contractor a
                    private

            observations in <em>Uber v Aslam</em>. The context was an argument by Uber that a driver should
            not be regarded as a “worker” because there was no contract whereby the driver undertook to perform
            work or services for Uber; rather, drivers were performing services solely for, and under, contracts
            made with passengers through the agency of Uber. Uber’s case was that the starting point for considering
            this argument should be to interpret the terms of the written agreements between Uber and drivers
            on the one hand, and between Uber and passengers on the other; and that the effect of these was that
            acceptance of a booking constituted a contract between the passenger and the driver to which Uber
            was not a party. It maintained that its only role was to act as a booking agent providing technology
            services and collecting payment as agent for the drivers.

        <div class="judgment-body__text">
            <p class="judgment-body__no-margin-top">In Lord Leggatt’s view there were
                two fatal objections to this argument. The first was that it was not the correct approach to
                deciding whether drivers were working under workers’ contracts with Uber simply to apply
                ordinary principles of the law of contract and agency. The second was that there was in evidence
                no written agreement between Uber and drivers, nor was there any mechanism whereby a driver gave
                authority to Uber to act as his or her agent. However, Lord Leggatt went on to say that there
                was a third objection, which was that if the contractual scheme was as described by Uber, it
                would be unlawful because the 1998 Act requires acceptance by the operator of a contractual
                obligation owed to the passenger to carry out the booking and to provide a vehicle for that
                purpose. He said:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“46. It is an important feature of the context in which,
                    as the employment tribunal found, Uber London recruits and communicates on a day to day basis
                    with drivers that, as mentioned earlier: (1) it is unlawful for anyone in London to accept a
                    private hire booking unless that person is the holder of a private hire vehicle operator’s
                    licence for London; and (2) the only natural or legal person involved in the acceptance of
                    bookings and provision of private hire vehicles booked through the Uber app which holds such a
                    licence is Uber London. It is reasonable to assume, at least unless the contrary is
                    demonstrated, that the parties intended to comply with the law in the way they dealt with each
                    other.</p>

                <p>
                    47. Uber maintains that the acceptance of private hire bookings by a licensed London PHV operator
                    acting as agent for drivers would comply with the regulatory regime. I am not convinced by this.
                    References in the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 to ‘acceptance’ of a private hire
                    booking are reasonably understood to connote acceptance (personally and not merely for someone
                    else) of a contractual obligation to carry out the booking and provide a vehicle for that
                    purpose. This is implicit, for example, in section 4(2) of the Act quoted at para 31 above. It
                    would in principle be possible for Uber London both to accept such an obligation itself and also
                    to contract on behalf of the driver of the vehicle. However, if this were the arrangement made,
                    it would seem hard to avoid the conclusion that the driver, as well as Uber London, would be a
                    person who accepts the booking by undertaking a contractual obligation owed directly to the
                    passenger to carry it out. If so, the driver would be in contravention of section 2(1) of the
                    Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 by accepting a private hire booking without holding a
                    private hire vehicle operator’s licence for London. This suggests that the only contractual
                    arrangement compatible with the licensing regime is one whereby Uber London as the licensed
                    operator accepts private hire bookings as a principal (only) and, to fulfil its obligation to
                    the passenger, enters into a contract with a transportation provider (be that an individual
                    driver or a firm which in turn provides a driver) who agrees to carry out the booking for Uber
                    London.
                </p>

                <p>
                    48. Counsel for Uber sought to resist this interpretation of the legislation on the basis that the
                    legislation was enacted in the context of ‘a long-established industry practice’ under which PHV
                    operators may merely act as agents for drivers who contract directly with passengers. Uber has
                    adduced no evidence, however, of any such established practice which the Private Hire Vehicles
                    (London) Act 1998 may be taken to have been intended to preserve. I will consider later two
                    cases involving minicab firms which were said by counsel for Uber to show that the courts have
                    endorsed such an agency model. But it is sufficient to say now that in neither case was any
                    consideration given to whether such an arrangement would comply with the licensing regime. The
                    same is true of cases also relied on by Uber (along with a notice published by HMRC in 2002)
                    which are concerned with how VAT applies to the supply of private hire vehicles. That material
                    in my view has no bearing on the issues raised in these proceedings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    49. It is unnecessary, however, to express any concluded view on whether an agency model of
                    operation would be compatible with the PHV licensing regime because there appears to be no
                    factual basis for Uber’s contention that Uber London acts as an agent for drivers when accepting
                    private hire bookings.”

            Mr Ranjit Bhose QC for Uber submitted that the issue was a pure question of statutory
            interpretation, to which the precise terms of Uber’s contractual arrangements with drivers and
            passengers are irrelevant. If the court were to hold that, in order to comply with the 1998 Act,
            an operator is required to undertake a contractual obligation to passengers to provide the
            journey, Uber would be required to - and would - change its operating model in order to comply.
            But that is not how Uber currently operates. Mr Bhose submitted that it is not necessary for
            Uber to do so. The 1998 Act does not seek to regulate any private law relationships which may
            arise between those engaged in providing and using private hire vehicles, save in relation to
            sub-contracting. Its provisions are regulatory in nature and do not require any particular
            contractual relationships. Operators are therefore free to choose whatever contractual model
            they wish. They may choose to contract as principal with a passenger to provide transportation
            services, but may equally choose not to do so, as Uber has done. References in the 1998 Act to
            “acceptance” of a booking refer only to acceptance of the regulatory responsibilities set out in
            the Act and in the operator’s licence.
            <em>Kingston upon Hull City Council v Wilson</em>
            shows that concepts of contract law should not be introduced into the 1998 Act which is
            concerned with regulation in order to ensure public safety.

            Mr Philip Kolvin QC for Free Now
            supported Uber’s submissions. He submitted in addition that there is a distinction between
            acceptance of a booking (which is what the operator is required by the Act to do and is what
            Free Now does) and the undertaking of an obligation to carry out the journey (which is what the
            driver does). Acceptance of an obligation to carry out the journey by the operator is
            unnecessary in order to ensure public safety, which is ensured by the fact that regulatory
            obligations are also imposed on the driver and the vehicle, both of which have to be licensed,
            together with the obligation on the operator to keep records at its operating centre.

            and the driver and does not provide transportation services (clause 2.2); that acceptance of an
            “Allocation” by a driver creates a direct contract between the passenger and the driver (clause 2.7);
            that Free Now is not liable for legal issues arising from the passenger’s contract with a driver,
            such as claims regarding breach of the contract or negligence on the part of the driver (clause 2.10);
            that Free Now is not jointly or severally liable for the services provided by the drivers because it
            is only an intermediary (clause 8.3); and that Free Now does not even guarantee that a driver is who they

    <h4>Analysis</h4>

        <span class="judgment-body__text">
            We begin with three points of common ground. The first, summarised by Lord Leggatt in
            <em>Uber v Aslam</em>
            at [70] but also stated in a number of other Supreme Court cases, is that <q>the modern approach
            to statutory interpretation is to have regard to the purpose of a particular provision and to
            interpret its language, so far as possible, in the way which best gives effect to that purpose</q>.
            Second, the purpose of the 1998 Act was accurately summarised by Mr Justice Ouseley in
            <em>Transport for London v Uber London Ltd</em>
            [2015] EWHC 2918 (Admin) at [28]. It <q>was to bring the hitherto unlicensed mini-cab trade in
            London within a licensed framework, to protect the public using the services of mini-cabs from a
            variety of mischiefs including unfitness of the driver, the safety of the vehicle, and the
            absence of insurance</q>, as well as to preserve a visible and regulatory distinction between
            private hire vehicles and black cabs. Third, it does not matter that at the time of the 1998 Act
            the concept of ride-hailing apps using smartphones was not within Parliament’s contemplation. In
            order to give effect to a plain parliamentary purpose a statute may sometimes be held to cover a
            scientific development not known when the statute was passed
            (<em>R (Quintavalle) v Secretary of State for Health</em> [2003] UKHL 13, [2003] 2 AC 687 at [24] and [25]).

        <span class="judgment-body__text">
            In our judgment the 1998 Act
            plainly contemplates that acceptance of a booking by the operator will create a contract between
            the operator and the passenger and, furthermore, that this will be a contract by which the
            operator undertakes an obligation as principal to provide the transportation service, that is to
            say to provide a vehicle and driver to convey the passenger to the agreed destination. That is
            what is meant by a “private hire booking”. The language of section 4, <q>private hire vehicles and
            drivers which are available to him for carrying out [a] booking accepted by him</q> indicates that
            it is the operator which carries out the booking (i.e. performs the contractual obligation to
            convey the passenger) and that it does so by means of the licensed vehicles and drivers
            available to it. The distinction proposed by Mr Kolvin between acceptance of a booking and the
            undertaking of an obligation to carry out the journey is illusory.
        </span>
    </p>

    <p class="judgment-body__section">
        <span class="judgment-body__number" id="paragraph_29"><a href="#paragraph_29">29.</a></span>
        <span class="judgment-body__text">
            The position is even clearer when
            the terms of section 5, set out above, are considered. Mr Bhose and Mr Kolvin had to accept that
            section 5 is concerned with sub-contracting by the operator and refers expressly to <q>the
            contract between the first operator and the person who made the booking</q> (subsection (4)) and to
            <q>a contract of hire between a person who made a private hire booking at an operating centre in
            London and the London PHV operator who accepted the booking</q>. Thus the contract between the
            operator and the passenger is a contract for the hire of a vehicle to undertake a journey. Mr
            Bhose and Mr Kolvin were driven to submit that section 5 applies when there is such a contract
            between an operator and a passenger, in which case sub-contracting is permitted; but that the
            Act permits an operator to accept a booking without creating such a contract; in the latter
            case, however, there is no scope for the operator to arrange for another operator to provide a
            vehicle to carry out the booking. They were unable, however, to suggest any reason why
            Parliament should have wished to legislate for only a sub-set of the ways in which an operator
            may offer its services to passengers. We can see none.

        <span class="judgment-body__text">
                To say that the 1998 Act <em>contemplates</em>
                that there will be a contractual obligation on the operator does not necessarily mean that the
                Act <em>requires</em>
                that there will be. In our judgment, however, the Act does so require. To interpret the Act in
                this way gives effect to the statutory purpose of ensuring public safety. As Mr Galbraith-Marten
                pointed out, passengers booking journeys on these apps may be vulnerable; the journeys may be
                booked late at night; the consequences of a driver failing to turn up may be serious. If the
                passenger’s only contractual relationship is with a driver he or she has never heard of and who
                is in any event unlikely to be worth claiming against, any claim is likely to be practically
                worthless. Conversely, if the obligation must be undertaken by the operator, the operator will
                have a powerful incentive to ensure that the drivers it uses are reliable and, if something does
                go wrong, a remedy against the operator is likely to be worthwhile.

        <span class="judgment-body__text">
            Section 56 of the 1976 Act, set
            out above, supports this view. It provides that every contract for the hire of a licensed
            private hire vehicle outside London shall be deemed to be made with the operator who accepted
            the booking for that vehicle whether or not he himself provided the vehicle. That demonstrates a
            clear parliamentary intention that the operator should undertake contractual responsibility. The
            language of the 1998 Act is different, but there is no reason for any different parliamentary
            intention in relation to private hire vehicle services in London.

            <em>Kingston upon Hull City Council v Wilson</em>
            does not stand in the way of this analysis. It was a case under the 1976 Act. Mr Wilson held an
            operator’s licence to operate from premises in Hull, while his wife held an operator’s licence
            to operate from premises in Beverley. A passenger telephoned the Hull office to make a booking
            for a journey in Hull, which was accepted, but it turned out that the Hull office had passed on
            the request to the Beverley office, who had then telephoned Mr Wilson (who was also the driver)
            to carry out the booking. The issue was whether the booking had been accepted in Hull (which
            would have been lawful) or in Beverley (which would not). The argument appears to have been
            concerned with an analysis, by reference to principles of offer and acceptance, of where the
            contract was concluded. Giving the judgment of this court on a case stated by the magistrates,
            Mr Justice Buxton said that he <q>was careful to eschew, as this Court in its judgment in the case
            of <em>Windsor and Maidenhead Royal Borough Council v Khan</em>
            was careful to eschew, any attempt to introduce the complications or, indeed, even the simpler
            parts of the law of contract into this matter. It is simply a question of asking, in common
            sense terms, whether there has been provision made in the controlled district for invitation or
            acceptance of bookings</q>.

            The case was not about whether there was a contract between the operator and the passenger. That
            issue could not have arisen in view of the terms of section 56 of the 1976 Act, which made clear
            that there was, due to the deeming provisions. Rather, the court was concerned to avoid
            technical arguments about where a contract is concluded when a series of telephone conversations
            take place between persons in different areas: jurisdictional issues aside, such questions are
            only rarely of any practical significance.
            <em> Windsor and Maidenhead Royal Borough Council v Khan</em>

            proceedings and has acknowledged that, if it were to fail to do so, that would provide grounds
            for TfL to take action. In these circumstances to quash the licence would be disproportionate,
            as well as having a potentially very significant impact on drivers using the Free Now app, who
            have no reason currently to believe that they are engaged in any unlawful activity, and a great
            many of whom make their livelihoods in this way.

            <p class="judgment-body__no-margin-top">The concept of “plying for hire”
                goes back to the era of the horse and carriage when not only the internet and smartphones, but
                even the motorcar, could not have been imagined. The earliest legislation to which we were
                referred in which this concept was used was section 35 of the London Hackney Carriage Act 1831.
                The current law is contained in the 1869 Act, section 4 of which contains definitions as

                Nevertheless some themes have emerged. We need refer to only three of the cases. First, in
                <em>Sales v Lake</em> [1922] 1 KB 553 Lord Trevethin CJ described plying for hire in the following
                terms:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    “In my judgment a carriage cannot accurately be said to
                    ply for hire unless two conditions are satisfied. (1) There must be a soliciting or waiting to
                    secure passengers by the driver or other person in control without any previous contract with
                    them, and (2) the owner or person in control who is engaged in or authorizes the soliciting or
                    waiting must be in possession of a carriage for which he is soliciting or waiting to obtain
                    passengers. If I may so express myself he must have appropriated, or be able at the time to
                    appropriate, a carriage to the soliciting or waiting.”

            Thus plying for hire consists of
            soliciting or waiting for passengers without any previous contract with them. In the case of a
            black cab, which is hailed in the street, there is no such prior contract or arrangement.

                Second, in <span>Cogley v Sherwood</span> [1959] 2 QB 311 it was held that there must be some
                “exhibition” of the vehicle to the public in
                order for the vehicle to be plying for hire. Lord Parker CJ noted that the cases were not easy
                to reconcile and that there was no authoritative definition (we would note that, although not
                referred to in the judgment, <span>Sales v Lake</span>
                was cited), and suggested that it was unnecessary and inadvisable to attempt to lay down an
                exhaustive definition. Nevertheless, included within the concept of plying for hire was that the
                particular vehicle in question should be exhibited in some way:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    “In the ordinary way, therefore, I should, apart from authority, have felt that it was of the
                    essence of plying for hire that the vehicle in question should be on view, that the owner or
                    driver should expressly or impliedly invite the public to use it, and that the member of the
                    public should be able to use that vehicle if he wanted to. Looked at in that way, it would
                    matter not that the driver said: ‘Before you hire my vehicle, you must take a ticket at the
                    office’, <em>aliter</em>, if he said: ‘You cannot have my vehicle but if you go to the office you
                    will be able to get a
                    vehicle, not necessarily mine.”

            Lord Parker recognised, however,
            that there were cases where a vehicle had been held to be plying for hire without being on view.
            Mr Justice Donovan agreed that the term connotes “some exhibition of the vehicle to potential
            hirers as a vehicle which may be hired”, although this does not necessarily require that the
            vehicle must be on view. Mr Justice Salmon also said that “a vehicle plies for hire if the
            person in control of the vehicle exhibits the vehicle and makes a present open offer to the
            public, an offer which can be accepted, for example, by the member of the public stepping into
            the vehicle”.

    <div class="judgment-body__section">

                The question is how the concept of plying for hire, including the requirements of soliciting,
                exhibiting and the absence of a prior contract, should be applied to the process of booking a
                private hire vehicle for an almost immediate journey by means of a smartphone app – in effect,
                how to apply concepts developed in an analogue world to digital technology. That was the
                question addressed in the third case which we refer to here,
                <em>Reading Borough Council v Ali</em>
                [2019] EWHC 200 (Admin), [2019] 1 WLR 2635, which concerned an Uber driver. The Council
                prosecuted the driver for an offence under the Act as it maintained he was “plying for hire”.
                This failed, and the Council appealed by way of case stated to the Divisional Court. The facts
                found by the Chief Magistrate included the following:

                    advertise any telephone number to contact in order to hire the car.

        <div class="judgment-body__text">
            <p>On these facts the Divisional
                Court, agreeing with the Chief Magistrate, held that there was no plying for hire. Lord Justice
                Flaux, with whom Mr Justice Holgate agreed, held that this was for three reasons:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    “33. In my judgment, there was no unlawful plying for hire in this case for a number of reasons.
                    First, the mere depiction of the defendant's vehicle on the Uber app, without either the vehicle
                    or the driver being specifically identified or the customer using the app being able to select
                    that vehicle, is insufficient to establish exhibition of the vehicle in the sense in which that
                    phrase is used by Lord Parker CJ in formulating the two-stage test for plying for hire in the 
                    <em>Cogley</em>
                     and
                    <em>Rose</em>
                    cases [
                    <em>Rose v Welbeck Motors Ltd</em>
                    [1962] 1 WLR 1010]. That requires not just exhibition of the vehicle but its exhibition
                    expressly or implicitly soliciting custom, inviting members of the public to hire the vehicle.
                </p>

                <p>34. It seems to me that depiction of the vehicle on the
                    app does not involve any exhibition of that kind, but is for the assistance of the Uber customer
                    using the app, who can see that there are vehicles in the vicinity of the type he or she wishes
                    to hire. I agree with Mr Kolvin QC that the app is simply the use of modern technology to effect
                    a similar transaction to those which have been carried out by PHV operators over the telephone
                    for many years. If I ring a minicab firm and ask for a car to come to my house within five
                    minutes and the operator says ‘I've got five cars round the corner from you. One of them will be
                    with you in five minutes,’ there is nothing in that transaction which amounts to plying for
                    hire. As a matter of principle, I do not consider that the position should be different because
                    the use of internet technology avoids the need for the phone call.</p>

                <p>
                    35. Second, it does not seem to me that the position is different because, as between Uber and
                    the driver, the latter is a principal and Uber is an agent. Whether this agency analysis is correct
                    has not been finally decided. However, like the Chief Magistrate and contrary to Mr Holland's
                    submissions, I do not consider that it has any bearing on the issue in this case. …
                </p>

                <p>
                    37. Whatever the correct contractual analysis, in my judgment it has no impact on the question we
                    have to decide. On any view, there is a pre-booking by the customer, which is recorded by Uber as
                    PHV operator, before the specific vehicle which will perform the job is identified. This is all
                    in accordance with the transaction being PHV business, not unlawful plying for hire. There was no
                    soliciting by the defendant without some prior booking, as he only proceeded to the pick-up point
                    after the customer had confirmed the booking and the defendant as driver had accepted the job.
                    Whenever any contract was concluded, I have little doubt that this was not plying for hire,
                    because on the facts found in this case, the customer could not use the defendant’s car without
                    making a prior booking through the app. As with the charabanc in <em>Sales v Lake</em>
                    , the customer would make a booking to be picked up at a pre-arranged point. On the
                    evidence in this case, all the Uber app did was to facilitate that booking.
                </p>

                <p>
                    38. This leads on to the third reason why this was not plying for hire, which is the character
                    of the waiting. The defendant was waiting in his vehicle until a customer confirmed a booking on
                    the Uber app and he accepted that booking. There was no question of his soliciting custom during
                    the period of waiting. His vehicle did not advertise itself as available for hire nor did he do
                    anything which would have suggested to the public that he was available for hire. Indeed, as the
                    Chief Magistrate found, if a member of the public had approached the vehicle and sought a ride,
                    the defendant would have refused to take such a passenger off the street without a prior booking
                    through the Uber app.
                </p>

                <p>
                    39. The waiting here was of a completely different character to that in <em>Rose’s</em>
                    case. Unlike in that case, the defendant was not waiting to solicit custom from passing members
                    of the public, but he was waiting for a private hire booking via the Uber app. Putting the example
                    given by Lord Parker CJ in <em>Cogley’s</em> case of what would not be plying for hire into the
                    context of the Uber app, if approached in the street, the defendant would have been saying:
                    'You cannot have my vehicle, but if you register for the Uber app and make a booking on it,
                    you will be able to get a vehicle, not necessarily mine’.”

                In his written and to some extent in his oral submissions Mr Matthias for UTAG submitted that
                the decision in <em>Reading v Ali</em> was wrong. As a matter of ordinary language, a vehicle
                plies for hire if it drives around or parks in a public place waiting for someone who wants to
                hire it. That is what a driver using the Free Now app does from the moment when he logs on to the
                app as available to carry out bookings. The requirements set out in the cases should be applied to
                the development of new technology. A vehicle whose location is shown on the customer’s smartphone
                screen is for all practical purposes exhibited as available for hire. He submitted that the booking via
                the app for a vehicle which may be less than a minute away is in effect instantaneous rather than a
                prior booking – hence the trading name “Free Now” and the fact that the services are described
                as “ride hailing apps” in a way which treats them as equivalent to hailing a black cab. He cited
                an extract from a 2015 press article by a former Mayor of London:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“You no longer need to see a vehicle to hail it. Your
                    phone will see it for you. It will see round corners; it will see in the dark. You no longer
                    need to hail a taxi by sticking your arm out or shouting; you just press a button and within
                    minutes – seconds – the car will be at your side. The car can be parked up at a petrol station,
                    or down a side street, or just dawdling in traffic, and – ping – it will be there. In other
                    words the app is allowing private hire vehicles to behave like black taxis: to be hailed, to ply
                    for hire in the streets, to do exactly what the law says they are not supposed to do. You have
                    the instant (or virtually instant) accessibility of the black cab, with none of the extra costs
                    entailed by the vehicle regulations or the Knowledge, and the growth of the business is
                    huge.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            Ultimately, however, Mr Matthias recognised that this court must follow a previous decision of
            the Divisional Court unless convinced that the decision is wrong (see
            <em>R v Greater Manchester Coroner, Ex parte Tal</em>
            [1985] 1 QB 67). This is a demanding test. Mr Matthias therefore submitted that the decision in
            <em>Reading v Ali</em>
            should be distinguished, primarily (as we understood his submissions) because, unlike Uber in
            <em>Reading v Ali</em>
            , Free Now’s User Terms state that the booking is made between the customer and the driver, and
            not with Free Now as the operator.

            Ms Maya Lester QC for TfL and Mr Kolvin for Free Now submitted that the case before us was on
            all fours with
            <em>Reading v Ali</em>
            . There was no material difference in the way that the drivers using the Uber app behaved,
            compared to those using Free Now, in the same way that there was no material difference in the
            operation of the two apps. A driver would wait, parked, or perhaps driving, until the app
            offered a hire to that driver, which would be accepted by use of the app. There was no plying
            for hire, and this point has already been decided by a court of like jurisdiction. Not only were
            there no proper grounds for distinguishing this most recent decision, it was in any event
            correctly decided.

    <h4>Analysis</h4>

    <p class="judgment-body__section">

        <span class="judgment-body__text">
            While <em>Reading v Ali</em> was concerned with specific facts – Mr Ali, parked in his car in Reading,
            waiting for a booking – we are concerned with the Free Now business model, the issue being whether Free Now
            facilitates or encourages its drivers to break the law by plying for hire. As we understand it,
            the way in which drivers using the Free Now app typically operate corresponds in all respects to
            the findings of fact made by the Chief Magistrate in <em>Reading v Ali,</em>
            which we have set out above. The contrary was not argued and we proceed on that assumption.
            Accordingly we are not concerned with the position which might arise if an individual driver
            chose to operate differently.

        <span class="judgment-body__text">
            On that basis, in our judgment <em>Reading v Ali</em> is in all respects indistinguishable from the
            present case. As demonstrated by Ms Lester and Mr Kolvin, the arguments advanced on behalf of the Council in
            <em>Reading v Ali</em> and rejected by the court were the same as those advanced on behalf of UTAG in this
            case. In particular, the court addressed the contractual position which comprises Mr Matthias’s principal
            ground of distinction, but stated in terms at [37] that <q>whatever the correct contractual analysis, …
            it has no impact on the question we have to decide</q>. We respectfully agree with that conclusion.
            Since the question whether a vehicle is plying for hire necessarily focuses on what it is doing
            <em>before</em> any contract is concluded, it can make no difference whether any contract of hire which may
            result is made with the operator or the driver.

    <p class="judgment-body__section">
        <span class="judgment-body__number" id="paragraph_55"><a href="#paragraph_55">55.</a></span>
        <span class="judgment-body__text">
            It is therefore our duty to follow <em>Reading v Ali</em>. We conclude, therefore, that Free Now does not
            facilitate or encourage its drivers to ply for hire and that this ground of challenge to TfL’s decision
            to grant it an operator’s licence must fail.

            It is therefore unnecessary to
            consider whether, if our decision had been otherwise, it would have been appropriate to quash
            the licence granted to Free Now. We note, however, that if private hire vehicle drivers using
            the Free Now app are plying for hire, there would need to be a significant change in the way
            that such drivers operate.

            We have concluded, perhaps not surprisingly, that the Supreme Court meant what it said in
            <em>Uber v Aslam</em> and that we must follow the decision of this court in
            <em>Reading v Ali</em>. Accordingly we grant a declaration in both proceedings that in order to
            operate lawfully under the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 a licensed operator who accepts a
            booking from a passenger is required to enter as principal into a contractual obligation with the
            passenger to provide the journey which is the subject of the booking. Otherwise we dismiss the claim for
            judicial review.
