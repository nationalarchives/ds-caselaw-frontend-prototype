      <span class="judgment-body__text">In 2019, the Bank agreed to provide financing to Gulf by way of a facility agreement and first demand guarantee dated 18 December 2019 ("Facility Agreement"). As security for this financing, the Bank and Gulf entered into a pledge agreement and a deed of assignment, both also dated 18 December 2019 (the "Pledge Agreement" and the "Deed of Assignment"). Under these agreements, amongst other things, all rights under bills of lading issued in respect of financed goods were pledged and assigned to the Bank. </span>

Issue 2: Alternatively, were Owners' obligations as regards the carriage of the Cargo contained exclusively in the Charterparty and/or the Novation Agreement of 6 April 2020?</span>

    </p>
    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">21.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">The crux of these issues is whether when BP ceased to be the charterer on 6 April 2020 by reason of the novation of the charterparty to Gulf, the contract of carriage at the time of delivery was contained in the Bill of Lading. BP remained the holder of the Bill of Lading at the time of delivery,</span>
    </p>
    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">22.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">I understood it to be common ground that where a shipper is also the charterer the bill of lading is not the contract of carriage of goods but a mere receipt. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">23.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">It is clear on the authorities that where a bill of lading is issued to a charterer and then indorsed to a third party, it attains contractual status upon indorsement on the basis that “<span style="font-style:italic">a new contract appears to spring up between the ship and the consignee on the terms of the bill of lading</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic">Tate &amp; Lyle Ltd. v Hain Steamship Co.</span> (1936) 55 Ll. L. Rep. 159, 174).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">24.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">However in this case there was no indorsement of the Bill of Lading to a third party; rather BP, the original shipper, ceased to be the charterer and thus from the date of the novation, the Bill of Lading was no longer in the hands of the charterer. (It seems to have been accepted for the Owners that the Bill of Lading was not endorsed to Gulf at any point - the Bank received the original Bill endorsed by BP in August 2020.)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">25.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">It was submitted for the Bank that there was no reason to distinguish the situation in this case from the position which would result on indorsement of the Bill. To the extent that a further contract came into existence between Gulf and the Owners which was contained in the novated Charterparty, it is the Bank's case (Reply paragraph 8 and 9) that that contract had no bearing on the Bill of Lading contract of carriage, or the rights or liabilities contained therein; the Novation Agreement operated simply as a transfer of rights and obligations under the Charterparty from BP to Gulf.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">26.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">It was submitted for the Owners that there was no authority to support this proposition for which the Bank contends. It was submitted that the Bank sought to draw a false analogy with the orthodox position and infer the creation of contractual rights. It was submitted (Defendant’s skeleton paragraphs 95 and 96) that by the novation the arrangements between the Owners and BP were terminated and BP did not intend the relationship to be governed by the Bill of Lading if their existing relationship was dissolved. </span>

      <span class="judgment-body__text">The Claimant appears to have sought to bolster its (pleaded) case by submitting in its skeleton for trial that the original contract of carriage was between BP Europa and the Owners and thus sought to establish a distinction between BP Europa as being the original holder of the Bill of Lading and BP as charterer and subsequent holder of the bill. However that factual case was not pleaded and was raised for the first time in the Claimant's skeleton. On its face the Bill states that the Cargo was shipped by "BP EUROPA SE· BP NEDERLAND O/B BP OIL INTERNATIONAL LTD". This would tend to suggest that BP Europa was shipping "on behalf of" BP and as this issue was not pleaded, no evidence has been sought or was advanced to counter the prima facie meaning and I proceed on the basis that the shipper and the original holder of the Bill of Lading was BP.</span>

	    <p>"This view is so long established that it is scarcely open to question. It is, however, not easy to explain. The lawful holder has by statute transferred to him all rights of suit under the contract of carriage, i.e. ''the contract contained in or evidenced by'' the bill of lading and may in certain circumstances become subject to liabilities under that contract. But <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">in the case of the indorsement from the charterer-shipper of a bill of lading differing from the charter, there is, per Lord Esher in Rodocanachi v Milburn, no ''contract contained in the bill of lading'', but only a ''mere receipt''. How, then, can the indorsement pass what does not exist</span>? Does a contract spring into existence on the transfer to the lawful holder, which had no existence before? And, if so, what statutory authority is there for such a ''creation'', as opposed to the ''transference'' ordained by statute? It may be said, as in Leduc v Ward, that between shipowner and indorsee the bill of lading must be considered to contain the contract, ''because the shipowner has given it for the purpose of enabling the charterer to pass it on as the contract of carriage in respect of the goods''. But this view, which appears to rest on some sort of estoppel against the shipowner, fails in the numerous cases where the variation from the charter is in favour of the shipowner and against the shipper and is also difficult to reconcile with the admitted law that a shipowner may repudiate against an indorsee for value a bill of lading, which his agent had no authority to give.</p>

But the legislative history of the 1992 Act shows that there was no intention of departing from the previously established position that the transfer gave rise to a contractual relationship between carrier and transferee on the terms of the bill of lading.

      <span class="judgment-body__text">The Claimant submitted that there was "<span style="font-style:italic">no reason</span>" to distinguish between the two different ways in which the Bill of Lading ceases to be a bill in the hands of the charterer, those two ways being transfer of the bill by indorsement, and novation of the charterparty.</span>

      <span class="judgment-body__number">46.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">However it was submitted for the Defendant that it was difficult to see why a new contract should arise on the facts of this case. In particular it was submitted (paragraph 97 of its skeleton) that the textbooks make clear that the reason why the transfer is said to give rise to the creation of a contract is because the shipowner is taken to have issued the bill of lading to the charterer intending to pass it on to a third party as the contract of carriage. It was submitted that by contrast in this case, at the time the Bill was issued, BP and the Defendant plainly did not intend their contractual relationships to be contained in the Bill of Lading. Rather the charterparty regulated those relationships. Whilst BP and the Defendant should be taken to have intended at the time the Bill of Lading was issued that it would regulate the legal relationship between the Defendant and a third party if BP transferred or indorsed the bill of lading to a third party, there is no reason to conclude that they intended that their relationship would be governed by the terms of the Bill of Lading in the event their contractual relationship was dissolved as it was by the novation. Thus it was submitted that it would be perverse to infer the creation of contractual rights in a document which previously had no contractual status, from an agreement in which the existing contractual relations were terminated.</span>

      <span class="judgment-body__text">In my view in the light of the authorities and the various commentaries discussed above, the Claimant has not established that the Bill of Lading contained or evidenced a contract of carriage after the novation of the charterparty. If and to the extent that this issue is not settled by the existing authorities, no satisfactory answer was provided by the Claimant in response to these submissions of the Defendant as to the way in which the intention of the parties can and should be analysed in this case. I accept the submission that there is no reason to conclude that the parties intended that their relationship would be governed by the terms of the Bill of Lading at the point where the contractual relationship between them in the charterparty had just been terminated.</span>

    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">60.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">To the extent that the Claimant relies on the fact that it was not the lawful holder of the Bill at the date of delivery and thus asserts that it was not entitled to authorise or permit delivery without production of the Bills, I note that in its Closing Note (paragraphs 45 and 46) the Claimant postulated what would have happened if the Owners had refused to discharge the Financed Cargo without production of the Bill. The Claimant asserted that the "<span style="font-style:italic">likely sequence of events</span>" is that the Owners would have contacted BP as the Bill of Lading holder to obtain instructions and had BP been contacted,  it was "<span style="font-style:italic">reasonable to assume</span>" that BP would have advised Owners that the Bill had been sent for endorsement and transfer to the Bank, that the endorsement and transfer was likely to take some time due to Covid restrictions and the Bank would have been contacted  by the Owners and asked what it wanted to do. It is the Claimant's submission (paragraph 47(1) of its Closing Note) (relying on the evidence of Mr Borchert and Mr Cotasson) that the Bank would have "<span style="font-style:italic">engaged with Owners and asked them not to discharge the Cargo without its consent"</span>.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">61.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">I note that in closing submissions counsel for the Defendant objected to the Claimant having raised the scenario above on the basis that this was a new factual basis raised first in the Claimant’s opening skeleton such that no evidence had been sought from BP. Further it was submitted that in light of the novation BP would have referred the owners to Gulf. In my view the key point for this purpose is that on the Bank's case, BP was the lawful holder of the Bill at that time yet the Claimant nevertheless accepts that it "<span style="font-style:italic">is reasonable to assume</span>" that the Bank would have been involved and would have sought to give instructions to the Owners (albeit that the Bank's case is that they would have told the Owners not to discharge the Financed Cargo).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">62.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">The Defendant submitted (paragraph 13 of its Closing Submissions) that had the Claimant been told that discharge would have taken place at Sohar by way of STS transfer it would have consented to such a discharge operation. The Defendant pointed to various occasions when Ms Bodnya was given information by Gulf and did not challenge the information. It was submitted for the Defendant (paragraph 30(14) and 31 of Closing Submissions) that if hypothetically Ms Bodnya had been told by Gulf that the Financed Cargo was to be discharged at Sohar to two STS Vessels she would not have objected and thus the breach (i.e. delivery without production of the Bill of Lading) did not cause the loss. </span>

    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">63.</span>

    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">i)</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">The evidence of Ms Bodnya should be accepted as truthful and representing the true position, that she would not have agreed to discharge into the Kutch Bay and the Prestigious, which is the necessary element for the Owners to establish any case of defence based on causation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">ii)</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">The essence of her evidence was that the Bank had already made every allowance to Gulf in respect of the numerous delays and changes in plan, due in large part, she said, to Covid issues. But yet another change of plan in circumstances where it was expressly or directly inconsistent with what Gulf had said that they were doing, would have been the "<span style="font-style:italic">final straw</span>".</span>

    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">iii)</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">Mr Van de Gaer's evidence was that it was “<span style="font-style:italic">unheard of</span>” for discharge to take place in small clips to, say, half a dozen receivers by STS.</span>

    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">64.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">As to whether the Claimant caused its own loss it was submitted for the Claimant that the only effective or proximate cause of the Bank's loss of its security interest was the misdelivery of the Financed Cargo from the Vessel, which meant that the Bank was not able to exercise its security interest set out in the financing documents over the Financed Cargo.</span>

Many of the matters which the Defendant raise as "<span style="font-style:italic">mistakes</span>" are in my view so characterised only with the benefit of hindsight.

      <span class="judgment-body__number">100.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">Ms Bodnya as the person responsible for managing the day to day relationship with Gulf, was the main witness for the Bank in these proceedings and in reality, the only witness who could address the liability case.  It is reasonable to infer that she would have been conscious when giving oral evidence of the significance of her evidence to the claim brought by the Bank.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">101.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">Given what came to light concerning the fraud and the loss suffered by the Bank, it is also reasonable to infer that in hindsight with the knowledge of the fraud, she may wish that she had acted differently and in particular had not accepted what she was being told by Gulf/ had made further enquiries. Accordingly in my view her evidence to the Court as to what she would have done if the Bank had been asked to permit delivery without production of the Bill including discharge at Sohar by STS has to be approached with some caution. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">102.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">In my view the evidence of the contemporaneous emails shows that although Ms Bodnya was actively chasing Gulf for updates as to the arrangements for the delivery of the Financed Cargo, she did accept the various explanations which were being given by Gulf over the period from the end of March to May 2020 including as to why the Financed Cargo could not be discharged into storage tanks at Fujairah, whether the Sub-buyers were related parties, why the Sub-buyers were willing to take the Financed Cargo at a price which was above the prevailing market price.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">103.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">As referred to above, when the Bank first entered into this transaction with Gulf, it was envisaged that the Financed Cargo would be held in storage tanks and a holding certificate issued to the order of the Bank. However, the plan changed and Ms Bodnya understood on 26 March 2020 from Gulf that the Financed Cargo would remain on the Vessel and would not be discharged as originally intended into Gulf storage tanks at Fujairah. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">104.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">When it became clear that the Financed Cargo would not be discharged into storage tanks but the Vessel would be used as floating storage, she did ask Gulf to arrange for the original Bill of Lading to be endorsed to the Bank. However as noted above, Gulf informed Ms Bodnya that the Bill would not be endorsed and transferred for some time due (largely) to Covid restrictions. As is evident from her emails she accepted this position (and given the evidence as to the impact of the Covid restrictions there can be no criticism of her in this regard). </span>
    </p>
    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">105.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">Ms Bodnya was then told by Gulf that the Financed Cargo would be sold in small clips of 5000-6000MT delivered from the Vessel. Her oral evidence was that she did not think however that there would be as many as 20 Offtakers and that she had only discussed with Mr Agarwal 6 or 7 Offtakers.</span>

    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">106.</span>

      <span class="judgment-body__text">As to whether the Sub-buyers were related parties to Gulf, Ms Bodnya insisted that she had done her own research and checked Gulf’s financial statements. However this was not referred to in her witness statement (paragraph 38) where she said:</span>

      <span class="judgment-body__text">Further it would appear that although Ms Bodnya queried whether, given that the market price had by then fallen significantly, the Sub-buyers would be prepared to take the Financed Cargo at the March pricing, the Bank accepted Gulf's explanation at face value that the Sub-buyers were prepared to do so because they were long term customers, an explanation which does not appear to have any commercial logic.</span>

    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">110.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">As to the importance to the Bank of the location of the discharge, I note that in her email of 20 April (above) Ms Bodnya referred to a need to declare the discharge location by 4 April. Ms Bodnya in cross examination stated that this was just because she was checking receipt of the various documents. This evidence seems at odds with the tenor of that email which contained both a request for the declaration of the discharge location and for a discharge schedule.  </span>

    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">111.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">More significantly Ms Bodnya was aware that the Vessel was at Sohar for a period of days although she said that she was not aware that the Vessel discharged the Financed Cargo at Sohar. Given the email from Gulf of 30 April 2020 stating that the Certificate of Quantity was about to be issued, it is surprising at least with hindsight that Ms Bodnya did not appreciate that discharge was occurring/imminent.  In any event I infer from her evidence concerning the location of Sohar that she was not, or would not have been, particularly concerned about discharge at Sohar. Such an inference is consistent with the fact that the Bank had already accepted that the Financed Cargo would not be discharged into the storage tanks at Fujairah and thus the Bank's additional protection through the storage arrangements had been given up.</span>

    <p class="judgment-body__section">
      <span class="judgment-body__number">112.</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">The Claimant submitted that if Ms Bodnya had been asked by Gulf to authorise discharge by STS she would not have done so. The Claimant did not seem to go so far as to submit that she would not have approved discharge at Sohar: in its submissions the Claimant submitted that Ms Bodnya did not know discharge was taking place <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">by STS</span> at Sohar. Although the Claimant submitted that it did make a difference to the Bank where and how discharge took place (paragraph 13(11) of its Closing Note) the Claimant did not appear to go as far as to submit that Ms Bodnya was unaware that discharge took place at Sohar or that she would not have agreed to discharge at Sohar.</span>

The market has been disrupted. So just, I guess this is important to state, that the experience I was having in the previous transaction I was indeed relying on it. But <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">in the circumstances of Covid, where there were problems with the access in the ports, where there were problems with the logistics, where there were problems with the personnel, that was something that I had to consider every time that the client was providing explanation to me</span>.

      <span class="judgment-body__text">The issue for the court is whether the failure by the Owners to require production of the Bill of Lading caused the loss or whether the Bank would have suffered the same loss in any event. Taking first the reasons advanced by Ms Bodnya as to why she would not have agreed to STS transfer, in my view:</span>

      <span class="judgment-body__number">i)</span>
      <span class="judgment-body__text">the Bank did not and would not have taken the view that the conditions of the financing had to be "strictly followed" so far as discharge was concerned – the Bank accepted that the Financed Cargo would not be discharged into storage at Fujairah even though this meant that the Bank lost the additional protection of control over the storage facilities;</span>

      <span class="judgment-body__text">any request for STS transfer would not have been the "final straw" – the Bank accepted the various explanations provided by Gulf even where in hindsight at least, it would appear that it should have challenged them e.g. the pricing of the Sub-contracts; and</span>

      <span class="judgment-body__text">Looking at the wider question of whether the Bank would have insisted on production of the Bill of Lading and whether it would have permitted discharge without production of the Bill, including by STS at Sohar, the evidence is that:</span>

      <span class="judgment-body__text">in relation to the Sub-buyers, Gulf had taken out trade credit insurance covering 90% of the receivables under the contracts with the Sub-buyers and the Bank had the benefit of an assignment of this policy and thus believed at the time that it was insured as to 90% against credit risk; and the Bank had received (or had no reason to believe that it would not receive) a 10% cash margin which covered the remaining credit risk.</span>
