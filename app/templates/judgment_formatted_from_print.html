                    determinations, following rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”), that the
                    imposition of stamp duty reserve tax (“SDRT”) at the higher rate of 1.5% on the issue of shares into
                    a clearance service or to a depositary receipts issuer was incompatible with EU law. A subsequent
                    ruling of the CJEU meant that the imposition of stamp duty at that rate on the transfer of shares
                    into a clearance service in certain circumstances was similarly incompatible with EU law. A large
                    number of claims were then brought against the Commissioners for HM Revenue &amp; Customs (“HMRC”)
                    for recovery of duties as money paid by reason of a mistake of law and/or damages. </p>

                    claims are stayed. I was told that there are now some 27 other claimants covered by the GLO (the
                    number of individual claims is higher since some claimants filed more than one claim) and that this

                    It follows that for each Affected Claimant all that remains to be determined is (i) the sums of duty
                    that it in fact paid, and (ii) whether that payment was made under a mistake of law. As regards (i),
                    the evidence filed for HMRC states that verifying this might require about a day’s work for a case
                    officer, which was not an excessive burden in view of the sums involved. As regards (ii), Mr Mark
                    Whitehouse of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, who has been involved in handling other such restitution
                    claims governed by a GLO, states that in his experience HMRC have been content to accept
                    confirmation in a witness statement from an employee of the relevant claimant that no relevant
                    individuals within the claimant company were aware that the relevant rules breached EU law at the
                    time when the disputed tax was paid. But in any event, the order proposed incorporates a mechanism

                    of the order, the remedy sought was of an interim nature on claims where the facts had not yet been
                    found. Jazztel was in a different position since it had been through a trial, and it therefore could
                    enjoy the benefit from having been the test claimant.</p>

                    Mr Baldry argued that, as a matter of principle, there could be no justification for lifting the
                    stay. It is inherent in the procedure of a GLO that while the test claim is proceeding through to
                    final determination, which includes determination of any appeal, the other claims in the GLO remain
                    stayed to await the outcome. That is shown by the position regarding summary judgment. If the stay
                    were lifted, an Affected Claimant would not be able to obtain summary judgment against HMRC: see
                    <span style="font-style:italic">Six Continents Ltd v Revenue Commissioners </span>
                    [2015] EWHC 2844 (Ch) at [27]-[35], where Henderson J held that summary judgment could not be
                    granted if permission to appeal had been given in a parallel case where HMRC raised the same point.
                    The grant of permission to appeal meant that the appeal had a real prospect of success, which was
                    effectively the same test as for refusal of summary judgment. If an Affected Claimant could not
                    obtain summary judgment, then it could only either seek an interim payment, which section 234
                    clearly precluded (subject to the exceptions in s. 234(3)); or seek to take its case to trial, which
                    was entirely contrary to the objective of a GLO.

                    had been introduced into the Finance Act 2013 precisely to protect HMRC from having to pay out

                    In my judgment, the order now sought is clearly an interim remedy within the scope of section 234.
                    There has not been a trial of the claims of the Affected Claimants. Nor can it be said that this a
                    technical or formalistic approach on the basis that if the stay were to be lifted the Affected
                    Claimants could recover summary judgment. I consider that summary judgment would be inappropriate,
                    even assuming that any factual issues concerning the sums paid and mistake made could be resolved,
                    for the reasons given by Mr Baldry. Although the
                    <span style="font-style:italic">Six Continents </span>
                    case was one where the claim lay outside a GLO and permission to appeal on the point of law had
                    already been given, I do not see that it can make a difference here that the question of permission
                    to appeal has not yet been decided. There has been a hiatus in resolving the permission application
                    because of the particular sequence of events before the Supreme Court. But no one could pretend that
                    the points regarding section 320 and its interaction with principles of EU law are straightforward.
                    That is highlighted by the fact that both sides are seeking to challenge the judge’s decision
                    regarding section 320, conversely on Issue 9A and Issue 9B. I was indeed told that in another case
                    concerning the application of section 320, the Chancellor has deferred giving judgment until the
                    outcome of the applications for permission in the present case have been determined.

                <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In this regard, s. 234(9) is significant. The statute
                    specially provides that proceedings on appeal are to be treated as part of the original proceedings.
                    As already mentioned, I consider that proceedings for which a permission to appeal application is
                    pending cannot be in a different position from proceedings where permission has been granted. Thus,
                    for the purpose of this application, the order sought for the Affected Claimants in the GLO is
                    founded on points of law which have not been finally resolved in those GLO proceedings. I do not see
                    that there is scope for some middle form of remedy between an interim remedy and a final remedy;
                    since what is being sought is therefore not a final remedy it must be an interim remedy within the
                    scope of that expression in section 234, even though it would not constitute an interim payment
                    under CPR Part 25.</p>

                    It follows that the court may not make the order sought unless either of the two conditions under s.
                    234(3) is satisfied. In that regard, the applicant seeks to rely on the second condition, which
                    itself has two elements: that the circumstances of the claimant are exceptional and that the remedy
                    is necessary in the interests of justice. I can see force in the argument that the second element is
                    satisfied since the order would prevent the other Affected Claimants being in a less favourable
                    position than the test claimant. But I am wholly unpersuaded that the first element is satisfied.
                    That requires exceptional circumstances
                    <span style="font-style:italic">of the claimant</span>
                    . The relevant claimant for this purpose is accordingly the claimant seeking a remedy, i.e. here,
                    the Affected Claimants. The mere fact of being in a GLO relating to a taxation claim cannot in my
                    judgment be regarded as exceptional, and the fact that the test claimant under the GLO has succeeded
                    at trial and been paid is not in my view a circumstance of the Affected Claimants. As for the delay
                    experienced by the Affected Claimants in recovering their money, that seems to me an inescapable
                    consequence of treating proceedings as not final until an appeal has been resolved, as specified by
                    s. 234(9).  I do not regard it as giving rise to exceptional circumstances, in particular where the
                    Affected Claimants should recover interest if they are successful at the end of the day (and indeed
                    they are seeking to claim compound interest).
