                        the additional documents were inter-conditional. Euronav also relied on a letter from Preston

                        counterfactual amendments but stated that Euronav would be making an application for specific
                        disclosure (a reference to the earlier refusal by UniCredit to give additional disclosure), and

                        additional

                        agreement being required between the parties (or permission from the court). Counsel for Euronav
                        was
                        obliged to accept that he could not (and did not) submit that the scope of future amendments was
                        entirely open by virtue of the absence of wording in the 14 January Consent Order limiting the
                        future amendments to consequential amendments but sought to imply a limitation which allowed

                        was

                        frauds committed by Gulf (also referred to at paragraph 7 of his skeleton submissions) and it
                        was
                        not suggested that the recent disclosure had revealed anything material as to the “scale” of the
                        fraud. I note that Mr Preston referred in his Third Witness Statement (at paragraph 13) to “a
                        wide-scale fraud that was discovered in the early summer of 2020”:</p>

                        lateness
                        of its application and in particular Euronav has not shown that this amended case, which in

                        whether Euronav have justified the lateness of the application.</p>

                        new case. I propose to assume that Euronav has met the relatively low bar of showing that the
                        proposed amendments have a reasonable prospect of success (noting as set out above that the
                        proposed

                        of delivery was an essential element of the case advanced by UniCredit. It seems to be
                        unnecessary
                        to resolve that legal issue. If Euronav is right in its analysis then UniCredit will need to
                        establish this issue as part of its case at trial but I cannot see that it would follow that
                        Euronav
                        should be allowed to plead a new and different case on delivery and a new case on causation.</p>

                        reason why UniCredit should have anticipated needing to do so; Euronav’s response to its RFI
                        dated 6
                        July 2021 did not suggest that UniCredit would be required to do so. UniCredit has not therefore
                        made any further enquiries beyond the investigations carried out by Athena because there was no
                        reason for it to do so.</p>

                        indeed – given the response to the RFI – it could reasonably assume was not being advanced. If
                        the

                        evidence,
                        and there is insufficient time for it to make additional investigations. It was submitted for
                        Euronav that UniCredit has not justified the need for a fresh investigation or what new
