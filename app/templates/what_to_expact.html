        <h1>What to expect from this new service</h1>
        <p><small>Last updated on 13th April 2022</small></p>
        <p>The Find Case Law service provides public access to Court Judgments and Tribunal decisions.</p>
        <p>From April 2022, court judgments from the England and Wales High Court, the Court of Appeal, the Supreme
            Court
            and tribunal decisions from the Upper Tribunals are being sent to the National Archives so that they can be
            preserved and made available to the public.</p>
        <p>It only contains judgments and decisions that have been handed down and made public. This does not include
            settlements made outside of court.</p>

            <h2>About this service</h2>
            <h3>Alpha service</h3>
            <p>The Find Case Law service is in the very early stages of development, referred to as Alpha. This means
                that
                this
                is the first version of the Find Case Law service.</p>
            <p>This service will develop and improve over the next few months and years. <a
                    href="https://corexmsnp4n42lf2kht3.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0lyyYAzfv9bGcyW">You can help
                contribute to
                the
                development of the service by giving us feedback.</a></p>
            <h3>What is Case law?</h3>
            <p>Case law is the law which is created through court judgments and tribunal decisions. This is sometimes
                known as
                common law. Judges will follow the 'precedent' or the principles used in previous judgments and
                decisions when
                deciding on a case. Case law can be used to clarify Legislation if it is unclear how it applies in a
                particular
                context.</p>
            <p>Legislation is law written by Members of Parliament (<abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr>) and
                is
                sometimes known as statutory law or the
                statute.
                <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/">You can find Legislation here.</a></p>
            <h3>Our legal basis for archiving and publishing case law</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/51/contents">The Public Records Act 1958</a>
                provides
                the
                legal basis for the Find Case Law service.</p>
            <p>Court judgments and tribunal decisions are public records. They fall within the scope of court records,
                defined
                by the <a
                        href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/51/schedule/FIRST/crossheading/records-of-courts-and-tribunals">First
                    Schedule</a> of the Public Records Act 1958. The judgments that are published through the Find Case
                Law
                service
                have been selected for permanent preservation and have been transferred to The National Archives in
                accordance
                with <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/51/section/3">Section 3</a>, or have been

            <p>Judgments and tribunal decisions are being preserved and made available to the public. The Keeper of
                Public
                Records at The National Archives is required to <q>take all practicable steps for the preservation of
                    records
                    under
                    his charge</q> under <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/51/section/2/3">Section
                    2(3)</a>,
                and
                to
                <q>arrange that reasonable facilities are available to the public for inspecting and obtaining copies of
                    those
                    public records in the Public Records Office which fall to be disclosed in accordance with the
                    Freedom of
                    Information Act 2000.</q> under <a

                    5(3)</a>. The Find Case Law service fulfils these statutory duties.</p>

            <h3>We do not provide legal advice</h3>
            <p>This service is designed to help you find court judgments or tribunal decisions. The National Archives do
                not
                provide legal advice, interpretation or support. You can find advice and support at:</p>

            <h2>Find a Judgment or Decision</h2>
            <p>You can search across the full text of every judgment and decision. You can also search and browse
                judgments,
                by
                neutral citation, court, party, judge and within a date range. These options can be combined on <a
                        href="/structured_search">the 'More Options Search' page</a>.</p>
            <p>You can find the latest published judgments and decisions as a list on <a href="/">the Find Case Law
                page.</a> Alternatively you can browse
                by
                court and filter results.</p>
            <h3>Search across the text of every judgment and decision</h3>
            <p>The search box on <a href="/">the Find Case Law page </a>allows you to
                search using any search terms including a neutral citation, name(s) and keyword(s). This will search the
                full
                text
                of every judgment or decision we have.</p>
            <p>You do not need to do a boolean search. Spaces in between words will act as an 'and'. Results where the
                words
                are closest together will be most relevant at the top of the search results.</p>
            <h3>Search specific fields</h3>
            <p>Alternatively you can search using one or more specific search terms on the <a href="/structured_search">'more
                search options' page</a>. The
                search
                boxes search particular fields. You can use multiple search boxes at the same time to help narrow down
                your
                search
                results. With the exception of Keyword, these boxes do not search the full text of judgments and
                decisions.</p>
            <h4>Neutral citation</h4>
            <p>The courts allocate a 'neutral citation' to judgments and decisions. This is a unique number and
                reference for
                each judgment and decision. The neutral citation is at the top of the judgment or decision. They are the
                official
                way to cite a judgment or decision.</p>
            <p>Examples of a neutral citation include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[2021] EWCA Civ 1847</li>
                <li>[2009] EWHC 2500 (Mercantile)</li>
                <li>[2013] EWHC 46 (Ch)</li>
                <li>[2021] EWCOP 18 [2019] UKSC 38</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They typically include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    the year the judgment or decision was handed down. For example: [2009]
                </li>
                <li>
                    the standard court acronym. For example: EWCA is England and Wales Court of Appeal
                </li>
                <li>
                    The standard acronym for the division of court. For example: Civ is Civil division
                </li>
                <li>
                    A unique number allocated by the individual court within a given year. For example: '1847' will be
                    the unique
                    number for the Court of Appeal civil division in 2021
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are struggling to find a judgment or decision using a neutral citation first check:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    you have written the neutral citation in full
                </li>
                <li>
                    there are no typos
                </li>
                <li>
                    the spaces are in the appropriate places
                </li>
                <li>
                    this is the neutral citation allocated by the court rather than the case number or a reference
                    number
                    issued
                    by a publisher
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also use neutral citations allocated by the British and Irish Legal Information Institute (<abbr
                    title="British and Irish Legal Information Institute">BAILII</abbr>) for judgments and decisions
                that do
                not have neutral
                citations allocated by the courts.</p>
            <p>If you are confident that the neutral citation is correct but are struggling to find it, it may be that
                we
                don't
                have that judgment within our collection. You can read more about our limited coverage of judgments and
                decisions.</p>
            <h4>Party Name</h4>
            <p>This is the name of someone involved in the case, such as the claimant or defendant. There are often
                multiple
                party names listed at the top of the judgment or decision.</p>
            <p>You can use the 'party name' search box on the 'more search options' page to only search against
                judgments or
                decisions where the name is listed as a party. This will not search for the name within the text of all
                judgments
                and decisions.</p>
            <p>There may be multiple results if the name is listed as a party in multiple judgments or decisions.</p>
            <p>You can search using multiple party names at once. This means you can use this search to search by case
                name.
                The
                case name is made from some (or all) of the parties listed as the appellant and defendant.</p>
            <p>For example: Cape Intermediate Holdings Ltd v Dring</p>
            <p>If you see a name that has been struck through on a judgment this means that the person has withdrawn
                from the
                case before it was decided.</p>
            <h4>Keyword</h4>
            <p>You can search the full text of every judgment and decision using a specific word or short phrase.</p>
            <p>Spaces between words will act as an 'and'. Quotation marks will search using that exact phrase only.</p>
            <h4>Judges Name</h4>
            <p>The Judge(s) who decided a case will be at the top of the judgment or decision.</p>
            <p>You can search by the name of the judge who has decided a case by using the 'Judge's name' box on the
                'more
                search options' page. This will mean that it will only search for judges that have given a judgment or
                decision
                on
                a case instead of searching every reference to the name of the judge within the full text of every
                judgment or
                decision.</p>
            <p>You can use a part of the name, the whole name, or the whole name and judicial titles.</p>
            <h4>Court / Chamber</h4>
            <p>The court or chamber where the case was decided will be at the top of the judgment or decision.</p>
            <p>You can browse by court or chamber division to see all the judgments and decisions we have received from
                that
                court.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-justice-system/court-structure/">You can find
                more
                information about courts and tribunals here.</a></p>
            <h4>Date</h4>
            <p>The date the judgment or decision was handed down on will be at the top of the judgment or decision.</p>
            <p>You can search by date range to look for judgments and decisions within a particular time frame.</p>
            <h3>Search results</h3>
            <p>The search results are ordered by relevance. Judgments and decisions that contain the search terms within
                their
                'metadata' will be listed above other judgments that only contain the search terms within the full text
                of the
                judgment or decision. Search terms within the text will be ordered by how many times that search term is
                used
                and
                the proximity between each search term.</p>
            <p>For example: if you searched for " Jones theft " then the Judgments with 'Jones' listed as a party name
                or
                Judges name will
                be at the top of the search results followed by judgments that use 'Jones' and 'theft' within the text
                of the
                judgment.</p>
            <p>You can filter results by date range, courts/chamber, party name, judges name.</p>

            <h2>Limited coverage of Judgments and Decisions</h2>
            <p>The Find case law service is an Alpha service. We are starting to receive judgments and decisions that
                have
                been
                handed down from the English and Welsh courts and tribunals.</p>
            <p>The initial collection of judgments and decisions totals to around 50,000 documents that date back to
                2003 for
                Court Judgments, and to 2016 for Tribunal Decisions.</p>
            <p>The collection includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    All judgments and tribunal decisions from the Upper Tribunals, High Court, Court of Appeal and

                    from 19th April 2022
                </li>

                    Judgments and decisions provided by <abbr title="British and Irish Legal Information Institute">BAILII</abbr>,

            <p>To widen the coverage of the service, we have bought digital copies of other judgments and decisions.We
                are
                currently working through these judgments and decisions to get them ready for publication and expand our
                collection.</p>
            <p>To begin with only judgments and decisions with neutral citations will be available. We are working to
                assign
                identifiers to judgments and decisions without neutral citations. You can find more information on our

            <h2>Understanding a Judgment or Decision</h2>
            <p>A judgment is the decision a court has made after hearing a case. Written judgments are also known as
                handed
                down
                judgments and can be very long.</p>
            <p>The National Archives do not provide summaries, interpretation or advice on any judgments or
                decisions.</p>
            <p>Every judgment or decision will start with a 'Header' or title page which contains the important
                information
                about the judgment or decision such as: the neutral citation, the case number, the court or chamber, the
                judges
                names, the parties' names.</p>
            <p>The way the text of each judgment or decision is written is up to the judge. Typically, judgments will
                summarise
                'the facts' of the case, the law that applies to those facts, the arguments presented in court, the
                decision the
                court has given and the reasons for the decision. The decision made by the judge is normally towards the
                end of
                the judgment or decision.</p>
            <p>You may find that some judgments and decisions have reporting restrictions. In these cases the relevant
                parts
                of
                the judgment will be obscured.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Transferring Judgments and Decisions from the courts to The National Archives</h2>
            <p>The National Archives is receiving a publication version of the judgment or decision. That means any
                redactions
                or anonymization needed for publication, should already have been made by the court.</p>
            <p>The Judges and clerks send us judgments and decisions as word documents using a service called Transfer
                Digital
                Records (<abbr title="Transfer Digital Records">TDR</abbr>). Only registered users can use this service.
            </p>
            <p>If you are a judge or clerk looking to for information about transfer digital records please email:
                <a href="mailto:caselaw@nationalarchives.gov.uk">caselaw@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How we publish Judgments and Decisions</h2>
            <p>It is important that court judgments and tribunal decisions are published, unless the Courts decide there
                is a
                strong reason to withhold a judgment or decision from the public.</p>
            <p>Judgments and decisions are sent to The National Archives ready for publication. We will never change a
                judgment
                or decision. Each judgment is published as a single web page. The styling of the original record is
                retained in
                the web page version, as much as possible.</p>
            <h3>Revisions</h3>
            <p>Over time we may receive several publication versions of the same judgment from the court. We will keep
                the
                digital record of all the versions, but only publish the latest version authorised by the court.
                Changes,
                refinements or corrections to the text of the currently published judgment can only be made by the court
                by
                sending a replacement version of the judgment through the <abbr
                        title="Transfer Digital Records">TDR</abbr>
                service.</p>
            <h3>Our due diligence</h3>
            <p>We have a dedicated team who are experienced with legal information who check every judgment and decision
                before
                we publish them on the Case Law service.</p>
            <p>We know that speedy publication is important for many of our users so for most judgments and decisions
                this
                means
                they will be published within twenty minutes of us receiving them.</p>
            <p>For judgments and decisions that contain highly sensitive information this may take up to 24 hours. Very
                occasionally we may need to double check the judgment or decision with the judge. In these cases the
                judgment or
                decision may take longer to be published while we wait for confirmation that we have received the
                correct
                publication version of the judgment or decision. We will not make any amendments to a judgment or
                decision on
                the
                court's behalf.</p>
            <p>If you spot an error within a judgment or decision you can email: <a
                    href="mailto:caselaw@nationalarchives.gov.uk">caselaw@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a></p>
            <h3>Take down Requests</h3>
            <p>Once a judgment has been published, we will only withdraw it from publication if we are instructed to do
                so by
                the judge / court.</p>
            <p>We have developed this publishing policy in consultation with the Judicial Data Working group that is
                advising
                us.</p>
            <p>For more information on our publishing policy please email: <a
                    href="mailto:caselaw@nationalarchives.gov.uk">caselaw@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>

        <section>
            <h2>Judgments and Decisions as data</h2>
            <p>We have made judgments and decisions available as data in order to facilitate transparency of the
                administration
                of justice and enable innovation. We have adopted the international standard Legal Document Mark-up
                Language
                (<abbr title="Legal Document Mark-up Language">LegalDocML</abbr>).</p>
            <p>Judgments and decisions are sent to us as Word documents using the <abbr
                    title="Transfer Digital Records">TDR</abbr> service. This is
                the
                digital record of the publication version of the judgment. We then create a digital surrogate of the
                record for
                publication and re-use. This is the <abbr title="Legal Document Mark-up Language">LegalDocML</abbr>
                version from
                which we create the
                <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr
                        title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>
                documents. <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=legaldocml">You can read
                    more about
                    <abbr title="Legal Document Mark-up Language">LegalDocML</abbr> here.</a></p>
            <p>This process allows us to have consistent data about judgments and decisions. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Neutral citation</li>
                <li>Court / Chamber</li>
                <li>Party Names</li>
                <li>Judges Name</li>
                <li>Date</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Data about new judgments can also be consumed as a data feed.</p>
            <h3>Uniform Resource Identifier (<abbr title="Uniform resource identifier">URI</abbr>)</h3>
            <p>In most cases we will use the neutral citation as the basis for how we uniquely identify judgments and
                decisions.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <p>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/id/{court}[/{sub-division}/]{year}/{neutral-citation-number}</p>
            <p>We have a dedicated team who will check that all new judgments and decisions we receive have a neutral
                citation.</p>
            <p>Neutral citations were adopted in 2001. Where a judgment doesn't have a neutral citation we will create
                an
                identifier using the standard court abbreviation, the judgment date and an ordinal sequence number
                assigned by
                The National Archives
                (assigned in order the judgments were received)</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <p>
                https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/id/{court}[/{sub-division}/]{year}/{judgment-date}/num/{tna-ordinal-number}</p>
            <p>In the case where a judgment or decision has had a neutral citation issued by <abbr
                    title="British and Irish Legal Information Institute">BAILII</abbr>, we will make the The National
                Archives'
                ordinal number the same as the one issued by <abbr
                        title="British and Irish Legal Information Institute">BAILII</abbr>. This means that there is
                1-1
                mapping of judgments between
                <abbr title="British and Irish Legal Information Institute">BAILII</abbr> and Find Case Law (when the
                header is
                replaced).</p>
            <h3>Enrichment</h3>
            <p>This is where we automatically find and hyperlink neutral citations and titles of legislation within the
                text
                of
                a judgment or decision.</p>
            <p>Neutral citation links will take you to the original judgment or decision if we have it as part of our
                collection
                of judgments and decisions. You can read more about our coverage of judgments and decisions.</p>
            <p>Links to acts of legislation will take you to the legislation as it stands today. You can use the
                legislation
                'point in time' feature to find legislation as it stood on a particular date or the original legislation
                passed
                by
                parliament.</p>
            <p>The National Archives are working to further enrich these judgments and decisions.</p>
            <h3><abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></h3>
            <p>The <abbr title="Legal Document Mark-up Language">LegalDocML</abbr> data for the judgments is available
                through
                the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>.</p>
            <h4>Accessing feeds</h4>
            <p>You can monitor a list of recently published or recently updated judgments using the Atom feeds available
                in
                our public API. An OpenAPI specification is available at
                <a href="https://github.com/nationalarchives/ds-caselaw-public-access-service/blob/main/doc/openapi/public_api.yml">https://github.com/nationalarchives/ds-caselaw-public-access-service/blob/main/doc/openapi/public_api.yml</a>.
            </p>

                </a></p>
            <h4>Detecting changes</h4>
            <p>At present, any update to a judgment will result in it being shown in the recently updated list; this
                could be
                a
                minor metadata change, an enrichment with extra links, or a new version from the original submitter,
                with a
                material
                change to the judgment.</p>
            <p>The judgment XML contains a content hash which will only change with material changes; you can use this
                to
                detect
                whether or not you need to re-import the DOCX for an updated judgment. In the near future, we hope to
                provide a
                feed
                that only shows material changes, so you will not need to keep a list of hashes.</p>
            <p>Example update detection workflow</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Poll the recently-updated feed</li>
                <li>Detect a new feed item using the timestamps in the feed</li>
                <li>Fetch the XML representation of the updated document</li>
                <li>Check the content hash against a stored value</li>
                <li>If changed, construct the URLand fetch the docx from the asset bucket</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In order to re-use the data you must be compliant with the terms set out in our licences.</p>

            <h2>Data Licensing arrangements</h2>
            <p>The goals with licensing court judgments and tribunal decisions for re-use are to facilitate open
                justice,
                enable
                innovation, while protecting the proper administration of justice.</p>
            <h3>The Open Government Licence does not apply</h3>
            <p>Judgments and decisions contain personal data. This means the Open Government Licence cannot apply as it
                excludes
                personal data.</p>
            <p>The National Archives has been working in consultation with the Ministry of Justice and the Judicial
                Executive
                Board (chaired by the Lord Chief Justice) to develop two licences that permit the re-use of judgments
                and
                decisions. Both licences are free to use.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/open-justice-licence">The Open Justice Licence,</a>
                    that
                    permits re-use but excludes computational analysis. You do not need to apply for this licence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A transactional licence that permits re-use including computational analysis. You will need to apply
                    for
                    this
                    licence.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The personal information within judgments varies but it can be very extensive and contain distressing
                content.</p>
            <p>It is for the court to decide whether reporting restrictions should apply. It is therefore possible for
                these
                decisions to be overruled in court and retrospective reporting restrictions be applied. It is therefore
                important
                you are aware of your obligations and are compliant with the licence terms when re-using the data to
                avoid being
                in contempt of court.</p>
            <h3>Personal data and <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr></h3>
            <p>Judgments and decisions contain personal data.</p>
            <p>Neither type of licence is a data sharing agreement or a processing agreement for personal data. Re-users
                are
                recipients of the judgments and decisions published by The National Archives. As a Data Controller,
                re-users
                will
                need to satisfy themselves that they have a legal basis and valid purpose for processing personal data.
                The
                licences and application process has been carefully designed so as not to create a Data Controller /
                Data
                Processor arrangement between The National Archives and the re-users (unlike the commercial licences we

            <h3>Open justice licence</h3>
            <p>You can use this licence to re-publish judgments or decisions on your own website. For example in a blog
                post.
                Computational analysis of judgments including basic search indexing is not permitted under this
                licence.</p>
            <p>You do not need to apply for this licence however you should be aware of the responsibilities you have.

            <p>You need to apply for this licence if you intend to use court judgments and tribunal decisions in a way
                that is
                outside the terms of the Open Justice licence. For example, to run computational analysis across
                judgments and
                decisions including basic search indexing.</p>

            <p>We work in accordance with <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/1415/contents">The Re-use of
                Public
                Sector Information Regulation 2015</a>. We will respond to your application within 20 working days <a
                    href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/1415/regulation/8">(Section 8)</a>.</p>
            <p>We do not discriminate against applicants <a
                    href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/1415/regulation/13">(Section
                13)</a>. Therefore if we have already granted a licence for the same purpose as described in your
                application
                then
                it will be granted within 20 working days.</p>
            <p>However, if your application describes an intended re-use that we have not previously considered this may
                take
                longer. Where we are uncertain that an application is consistent with the administration of justice we
                will ask
                for clarification from the Ministry of Justice and the Judiciary</p>
            <p>Once your licence is granted you can be confident that your re-use of the data is consistent with the
                proper
                administration of justice. The term of the licence is 1 calendar year from the date the licence has been
                granted.</p>
            <p>If you are unsure please apply.</p>
