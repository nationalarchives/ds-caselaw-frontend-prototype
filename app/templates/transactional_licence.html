        <h2>Part 1 &ndash; Instructions</h2>

        <h3>How to apply</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Read Part 1 &ndash; Instructions.</li>
            <li>Answer all the relevant questions in Part 2 &ndash; Application Form.</li>
            <li>Submit your completed application form, by email, to The National Archives’ Licensing Team at:
                <a href="mailto:CaselawLicence@nationalarchives.gov.uk">CaselawLicence@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Who is the application form for?</h3>
        <p>You need to complete an application form if you intend to use Court Judgments and/or Tribunal Decisions
            information in a way that is outside the terms of the <a href="/open-justice-licence">Open Justice -
                Licence</a>.</p>
        <p>For example, you will need to apply for a licence if you are undertaking any type of computational analysis
            of
            judgments and tribunal decisions, including by compiling a search engine index.</p>
        <p>Anyone can apply for a licence and there is no charge to apply.</p>

        <h3>Why is a licence necessary?</h3>
        <p>Open Justice is a fundamental constitutional principle and necessary for the rule of law. It is important
            that
            Court Judgments and Tribunal Decisions are published and made available for re-use by third parties. It is
            also
            important that re-users understand their responsibilities and do not jeopardise the proper administration of
            justice.</p>
        <p>The Crown holds rights (copyright and database rights) in Court Judgments and Tribunal Decisions. In order to
            re-use the information you need permission from the Keeper of Public Records, as the Crown’s officeholder
            under
            Letters Patent, for the re-use of this material. <a href="/open-justice-licence">Open Justice &ndash;
                Licence</a> provides standard terms for re-use. If
            the purpose of the re-use cannot be met within the terms of the Open Justice Licence, re-users need to apply
            for
            a
            specific licence from The National Archives.</p>

        <h3>Exclusions from the licence</h3>
        <p>We will licence the information ‘as is’ and exclude all representations, warranties, obligations and
            liabilities
            in relation to the information to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
        <p>We will not be liable for any errors or omissions in the information. We will not be liable for any loss,
            injury
            or damage of any kind caused by its use.</p>

        <h3>Personal data</h3>
        <p>Court Judgments and Tribunal Decisions contain information about people. This typically includes the names of
            parties and other people mentioned in the judgment or decision, as well as the representatives of the
            parties,
            and
            the names of the judges hearing the case. The information about people varies. It can include a variety of
            types
            of special category personal data, depending on the subject matter of the case.</p>
        <p>Any licence we issue will only apply to the currently published version of the Court Judgments and Tribunal
            Decisions (as published by the Keeper of Public Records on The National Archives’ Case Law website).</p>
        <p>As a recipient of the information, you are responsible for complying with any judicial decision that
            restricts
            the use of personal data within it. If you choose to store and process the information, you will be a Data
            Controller under UK data protection law. You need to satisfy yourself that you have a legal basis and valid
            purpose for processing the personal data.</p>
        <p>For the avoidance of doubt:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the licence we issue will not be a data sharing agreement for personal data; and</li>
            <li>the licence we issue will not be a processing agreement for personal data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is the purpose of the questions?</h3>
        <p>The questions in this form will help The National Archives understand how you intend to re-use the
            information.</p>
        <p>Court Judgments and Tribunal Decisions contain sensitive information. Your answers to the questions will help
            us
            to understand how you will re-use the information. They will also help you to understand your obligations.
            We
            are
            using the “five safes” framework to group the questions.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Safe people</li>
            <li>Safe projects</li>
            <li>Safe data</li>
            <li>Safe settings</li>
            <li>Safe outputs</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You should answer the questions as fully as possible.</p>

        <h3>What will The National Archives do with the information?</h3>
        <p>The National Archives is licensing the information in accordance with its obligations under the Re-use of
            Public
            Sector Information Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/1415).</p>
        <p>We will keep a record of your application.</p>
        <p>We will consider whether the purpose of your re-use is likely to jeopardise the proper administration of
            justice. We may ask you for some additional information or to submit a revised application form. We may
            consult
            the Ministry of Justice, including any advisory body or group it establishes from time to time.</p>
