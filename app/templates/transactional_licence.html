    <h1>Application to re-use Court Judgments and Tribunal Decisions</h1>

    <h2>Part 1 &ndash; Instructions</h2>

    <h3>How to apply</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Read Part 1 &ndash; Instructions.</li>
        <li>Answer all the relevant questions in Part 2 &ndash; Application Form.</li>
        <li>Submit your completed application form, by email, to The National Archives’ Licensing Team at:
            <a href="mailto:CaselawLicence@nationalarchives.gov.uk">CaselawLicence@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Who is the application form for?</h3>
    <p>You need to complete an application form if you intend to use Court Judgments and/or Tribunal Decisions
        information in a way that is outside the terms of the <a href="/open-justice-licence">Open Justice Licence</a>.
    </p>
    <p>For example, you will need to apply for a licence if you are undertaking any type of computational analysis
        of judgments and tribunal decisions, including by compiling a search engine index.</p>
    <p>Anyone can apply for a licence and there is no charge to apply.</p>

    <h3>Why is a licence necessary?</h3>
    <p>Open Justice is a fundamental constitutional principle and necessary for the rule of law. It is important that
        Court Judgments and Tribunal Decisions are published and made available for re-use by third parties. It is
        also important that re-users understand their responsibilities and do not jeopardise the proper administration
        of justice.</p>
    <p>The Crown holds rights (copyright and database rights) in Court Judgments and Tribunal Decisions. In order to
        re-use the information you need permission from the Keeper of Public Records, as the Crown’s officeholder
        under Letters Patent, for the re-use of this material. <a href="/open-justice-licence">Open Justice Licence</a>
        provides standard terms for re-use. If the purpose of the re-use cannot be met within the terms of the Open
        Justice Licence, re-users need to apply
        for a specific licence from The National Archives.</p>

    <h3>Exclusions from the licence</h3>
    <p>We will licence the information ‘as is’ and exclude all representations, warranties, obligations and liabilities
        in relation to the information to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
    <p>We will not be liable for any errors or omissions in the information. We will not be liable for any loss, injury
        or damage of any kind caused by its use.</p>

    <h3>Personal data</h3>
    <p>Court Judgments and Tribunal Decisions contain information about people. This typically includes the names of
        parties and other people mentioned in the judgment or decision, as well as the representatives of the parties,
        and the names of the judges hearing the case. The information about people varies. It can include a variety of
        types of special category personal data, depending on the subject matter of the case.</p>
    <p>Any licence we issue will only apply to the currently published version of the Court Judgments and Tribunal
        Decisions (as published by the Keeper of Public Records on The National Archives’ Case Law website).</p>
    <p>As a recipient of the information, you are responsible for complying with any judicial decision that
        restricts the use of personal data within it. If you choose to store and process the information, you will be a
        Data
        Controller under UK data protection law. You need to satisfy yourself that you have a legal basis and valid
        purpose for processing the personal data.</p>
    <p>For the avoidance of doubt:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the licence we issue will not be a data sharing agreement for personal data; and</li>
        <li>the licence we issue will not be a processing agreement for personal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is the purpose of the questions?</h3>
    <p>The questions in this form will help The National Archives understand how you intend to re-use the information.
    </p>
    <p>Court Judgments and Tribunal Decisions contain sensitive information. Your answers to the questions will help
        us to understand how you will re-use the information. They will also help you to understand your obligations.
        We are using the “five safes” framework to group the questions.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Safe people</li>
        <li>Safe projects</li>
        <li>Safe data</li>
        <li>Safe settings</li>
        <li>Safe outputs</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You should answer the questions as fully as possible.</p>

    <h3>What will The National Archives do with the information?</h3>
    <p>The National Archives is licensing the information in accordance with its obligations under the Re-use of
        Public Sector Information Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/1415).</p>
    <p>We will keep a record of your application.</p>
    <p>We will consider whether the purpose of your re-use is likely to jeopardise the proper administration of
        justice. We may ask you for some additional information or to submit a revised application form. We may
        consult the Ministry of Justice, including any advisory body or group it establishes from time to time.</p>
