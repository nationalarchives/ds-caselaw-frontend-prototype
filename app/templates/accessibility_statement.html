                <p>This accessibility statement applies to the Case Law service provided by The National Archives.</p>
                <p>Accessibility and inclusion are important to everyone at The National Archives and we want as many
                    people
                    as possible to be able to use the Case Law service. The text should be
                    clear and easy to understand. You should be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change colours, contrast levels and fonts.</li>
                    <li>Zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen.</li>
                    <li>Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard.</li>
                    <li>Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software.</li>
                    <li>Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS,
                        NVDA and VoiceOver).

                    teams. We acknowledge that this approach is not perfect and recognise that we may get some things
                    wrong,
