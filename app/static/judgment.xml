However that factual case was not pleaded and was raised for the first time in the Claimant's skeleton. On its face the Bill states that the Cargo was shipped by "BP EUROPA SE· BP NEDERLAND O/B BP OIL INTERNATIONAL LTD". This would tend to suggest that BP Europa was shipping "on behalf of" BP and as this issue was not pleaded, no evidence has been sought or was advanced to counter the prima facie meaning and I proceed on the basis that the shipper and the original holder of the Bill of Lading was BP.</p>

            <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"This view is so long established that it is scarcely open to question. It is, however, not easy to explain. The lawful holder has by statute transferred to him all rights of suit under the contract of carriage, i.e. ''the contract contained in or evidenced by'' the bill of lading and may in certain circumstances become subject to liabilities under that contract. But <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">in the case of the indorsement from the charterer-shipper of a bill of lading differing from the charter, there is, per Lord Esher in Rodocanachi v Milburn, no ''contract contained in the bill of lading'', but only a ''mere receipt''. How, then, can the indorsement pass what does not exist</span>? Does a contract spring into existence on the transfer to the lawful holder, which had no existence before? And, if so, what statutory authority is there for such a ''creation'', as opposed to the ''transference'' ordained by statute? It may be said, as in Leduc v Ward, that between shipowner and indorsee the bill of lading must be considered to contain the contract, ''because the shipowner has given it for the purpose of enabling the charterer to pass it on as the contract of carriage in respect of the goods''. But this view, which appears to rest on some sort of estoppel against the shipowner, fails in the numerous cases where the variation from the charter is in favour of the shipowner and against the shipper and is also difficult to reconcile with the admitted law that a shipowner may repudiate against an indorsee for value a bill of lading, which his agent had no authority to give.</p>

            <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Possibly the difficulty may be resolved by a consideration of the wording of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 itself. Section 2(1) transfers to the lawful holder of the bill of lading all rights of suit ''under the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to that contract''. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">The definition of ''contract of carriage'' in s.5(1)(a) presupposes that the bill of lading does contain or evidence a contract: but if it is a mere receipt and the governing document is the charterparty it does not do so</span>. As, however, the words of the statute must be given a sensible meaning, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">it is submitted that the true meaning is that the lawful holder has vested in him all rights of suit ''as if there had been a contract in the terms contained in the bill of lading and he had been a party to that contract''</span>.

            <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"…A similar difficulty arises under the 1992 Act which provides for the transfer of rights to the transferee "as if he had been a party to" the "contract contained in or evidenced by" the bill of lading: <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">again the difficulty is that before the transfer no contract of carriage is contained in or even evidenced by the bill of lading, the contract of carriage being at this stage contained in the charterparty</span>. But the legislative history of the 1992 Act shows that there was no intention of departing from the previously established position that the transfer gave rise to a contractual relationship between carrier and transferee on the terms of the bill of lading. This was explained by saying that a new contract "sprang up" when the bill was indorsed. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Exactly why or how such a contract should "spring up" at the time of the transfer between parties who were not at this stage in contact with each other is not altogether clear; perhaps the best explanation (if it can be regarded as one) is that such a contract was a legal device, invented to avoid what would otherwise be a commercially inconvenient result</span>. At any rate, the argument that a new contract springs up is no weaker now under the 1992 Act) than it was under the Act of 1855…" [Emphasis added]</p>

In particular it was submitted (paragraph 97 of its skeleton) that the textbooks make clear that the reason why the transfer is said to give rise to the creation of a contract is because the shipowner is taken to have issued the bill of lading to the charterer intending to pass it on to a third party as the contract of carriage. It was submitted that by contrast in this case, at the time the Bill was issued, BP and the Defendant plainly did not intend their contractual relationships to be contained in the Bill of Lading. Rather the charterparty regulated those relationships. Whilst BP and the Defendant should be taken to have intended at the time the Bill of Lading was issued that it would regulate the legal relationship between the Defendant and a third party if BP transferred or indorsed the bill of lading to a third party, there is no reason to conclude that they intended that their relationship would be governed by the terms of the Bill of Lading in the event their contractual relationship was dissolved as it was by the novation. Thus it was submitted that it would be perverse to infer the creation of contractual rights in a document which previously had no contractual status, from an agreement in which the existing contractual relations were terminated.</p>

The Claimant asserted that the "<span style="font-style:italic">likely sequence of events</span>" is that the Owners would have contacted BP as the Bill of Lading holder to obtain instructions and had BP been contacted,  it was "<span style="font-style:italic">reasonable to assume</span>" that BP would have advised Owners that the Bill had been sent for endorsement and transfer to the Bank, that the endorsement and transfer was likely to take some time due to Covid restrictions and the Bank would have been contacted  by the Owners and asked what it wanted to do. It is the Claimant's submission (paragraph 47(1) of its Closing Note) (relying on the evidence of Mr Borchert and Mr Cotasson) that the Bank would have "<span style="font-style:italic">engaged with Owners and asked them not to discharge the Cargo without its consent"</span>.</p>

Further it was submitted that in light of the novation BP would have referred the owners to Gulf. In my view the key point for this purpose is that on the Bank's case, BP was the lawful holder of the Bill at that time yet the Claimant nevertheless accepts that it "<span style="font-style:italic">is reasonable to assume</span>" that the Bank would have been involved and would have sought to give instructions to the Owners (albeit that the Bank's case is that they would have told the Owners not to discharge the Financed Cargo).</p>

The Defendant pointed to various occasions when Ms Bodnya was given information by Gulf and did not challenge the information. It was submitted for the Defendant (paragraph 30(14) and 31 of Closing Submissions) that if hypothetically Ms Bodnya had been told by Gulf that the Financed Cargo was to be discharged at Sohar to two STS Vessels she would not have objected and thus the breach (i.e. delivery without production of the Bill of Lading) did not cause the loss. </p>

In any event I infer from her evidence concerning the location of Sohar that she was not, or would not have been, particularly concerned about discharge at Sohar. Such an inference is consistent with the fact that the Bank had already accepted that the Financed Cargo would not be discharged into the storage tanks at Fujairah and thus the Bank's additional protection through the storage arrangements had been given up.</p>
